In Greek mythology , Pandora was the first mortal woman .
According to Hesiod , each god helped create her by giving her unique gifts . <SEP> All the gods helped by giving her seductive gifts .
Another name was found for her was Anesidora , she who sends gifts . <SEP> This name was found inscribed against her figure on a white-ground " kylix " in the British Museum .
In the literary versions , the myth is a kind of theodicy , it addresses the question why there is evil in the world .
He shortly mentions it in his Theogony , in line 570 , but does not name Pandora . <SEP> In his Works and Days he gives the oldest known literary version of the story .
The Pandora myth first appears in lines 560 – 612 of Hesiod 's poem the " Theogony " .
Prometheus has stolen the gift of fire , and has given it to the humans . <SEP> Zeus is angry about this and decides to punish men , as a compensation for the gift .
He commands Hephaestus to make the first woman from earth . <SEP> This woman is described as a " beautiful evil " whose descendants would torment the race of men .
After Hephaestus does so , Athena dressed her in a silvery gown , an embroidered veil , garlands and a crown of gold .
This woman is unnamed in the " Theogony " , but is probably Pandora . <SEP> Hesiod rewrote her myth in " Works and Days " .
The more famous version of the myth comes from another of Hesiod 's works , called " Works and Days " .
There , the myth is contained in lines 60 to 105 . <SEP> He also makes the scope of the misery she inflicts on mankind bigger .
As before , she is created by Hephaestus , but now more gods help completing her ( lines 63-82 ) : Athena taught her needlework and weaving ( 63 – 4 ) ; Aphrodite " shed grace upon her head and cruel longing and cares that weary the limbs " ( 65 – 6 ) ; Hermes gave her " a shameful mind and deceitful nature " ( 67 – 8 ) ; Hermes also gave her the power of speech , putting in her " lies and crafty words " ( 77 – 80 ) ; Athena then clothed her ( 72 ) ; next she , Persuasion and the Charites adorned her with necklaces and other finery ( 72 – 4 ) ; the Horae adorned her with a garland crown ( 75 ) .
The story is written in such a way that Pandora 's feminine and deceitful nature is a small problem for mankind , because she brings a " pithos " .
The box contains " burdensome toil and sickness that brings death to men " ( 91 – 2 ) , diseases ( 102 ) and " a myriad other pains " ( 100 ) .
Prometheus had warned his brother Epimetheus not to accept any gifts from Zeus .
One item , however , did not escape the jar ( 96 – 9 ) , hope : Only Hope was left within her unbreakable house , she remained under the lip of the jar , and did not fly away .
West cites Hesiod 's " Catalogue of Women " , which preserved the older version . <SEP> In one version of the story , the jar may have contained only good things for mankind .
West also writes that it may have been that Epimetheus and Pandora and their roles were transposed in the pre-Hesiodic myths . <SEP> This is called a " mythic inversion " .
He remarks that there is a curious correlation between Pandora being made out of earth in Hesiod 's story , to what is in Apollodorus that Prometheus created man from water and earth .
Hesiod 's myth of Pandora 's jar , then , could be an summary of many different early myths .
An incorrect etymology of Pandora 's name , " all-gifted " , was provided in " Works and Days " .
Pandora means " all-giving " , but not " all-gifted . "
Some paintings in vases , from the fifth century before Christ , indicate that the beliefs about the goddess Pandora lasted after the time of Hesiod .
Another name of Pandora was found in a kylix ( circa 460 BC ) , " Anesidora " , that means " she who sends up gifts . "
This vase painting depicts Hephaestus and Athenae finishing the touches on the first woman , like in the " Theogony " .
The epithet " anesidora " is also used to name Gaia or Demeter .
T. A. Sinclair , commenting on " Works and Days " argues that Hesiod shows no awareness of the mythology of such a divine " giver " .
A.H. Smith , however , notes that in Hesiod 's account Athena and the Seasons brought wreaths of grass and spring flowers to Pandora , indicating that Hesiod was conscious of Pandora 's original " all-giving " function .
Jane Ellen Harrison sees in Hesiod 's story " evidence of a shift from matriarchy to patriarchy in Greek culture .
( Harrison 1922:284 ) Robert Graves , quoting Harrison , asserts of the Hesiodic episode that " Pandora is not a genuine myth , but an anti-feminist fable , probably of his own invention . "
H.J.Rose wrote that the myth of Pandora is decidedly more illiberal than that of epic in that it makes Pandora the origin of all of Man 's woes with her being the exemplification of the bad wife .

Claudius ; 1 August 10 BC – 13 October 54 AD ) was the fourth Roman Emperor .
His great-uncle was the first Emperor Augustus , and his uncle was the second Emperor Tiberius .
His nephew was the third Emperor , Caligula .
His maternal grandfather was Mark Antony .
Claudius ' infirmity may have saved him from the purges of Tiberius ' and Caligula 's reigns ; enemies did not see him as a serious threat .
He was declared Emperor at the insistence of the Praetorian Guard after Caligula 's assassination .
Despite his lack of experience , Claudius proved a good administrator and a great builder of public works .
His reign saw an expansion of the Empire , and the conquest of Britain .

A water footprint is the amount of freshwater used by individuals , groups or companies in order to make goods or provide services used by the community .
A water footprint can be determined by math for any well-established group of users , or producers .
It is measured by dividing the total amount of water used , by the water that became polluted , in the same area during the same amount of time .
While the water footprint of an organization is a good indicator for its water consumption and pollution , it does not show how other water sources are affected .
The water footprint concept was introduced in 2002 by A.Y. Hoekstra from UNESCO-IHE as an alternative indicator of water use.2.
The most elaborate publications on how to estimate water footprints are a 2004-report on the ' Water footprint of nations ' from UNESCO-IHE 3 and the 2008-book Globalization of Water by A.Y. Hoekstra and A.K. Chapagain , published by Blackwell , 2008 .
Cooperation between global leading institutions in the field has led to the establishment of the Water Footprint Network in 2008 that aims to coordinate efforts to further develop and disseminate knowledge on water footprint concepts , methods and tools .

Achillobator is a dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous period of what is now Mongolia . <SEP> It lived about 90 million years ago .
It was probably an active predator , hunting with the large sickle-shaped claw on the second toe of each foot .
It was a large dromaeosaurid : the first and only individual specimen found is estimated at being 5 meters ( 17 feet ) long .
The name comes from Achilles , a famous ancient Greek warrior of the Trojan War .
It refers to the large Achilles tendon needed to use the sickle claw on the foot , which was the major weapon of dromaeosaurids .
The one species is named " A. giganticus " because it is much larger than other dromaeosaurids .

It is the fourth largest planet and third heaviest .
It is seventeen times heavier than Earth and is a little bit heavier than Uranus .
It was named after the Roman God of the Sea .
Neptune was discovered by the astronomers Urbain Le Verrier and John Couch Adams . <SEP> The largest , and the only one big enough to have the shape of a sphere is Triton , ( pronounced : ˈtraɪtən ) discovered by William Lassell just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself .
Neptune has a total of 14 known moons .
Unlike all other large planetary moons , Triton has a retrograde orbit , showing that the moon was probably captured , and maybe was once a Kuiper belt object .
It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a synchronous orbit , and is slowly moving into Neptune and will one day be torn apart when it passes the Roche limit .
Triton is the coldest object that has been measured in the solar system , with temperatures of − 235 ° C ( 38 K , − 392 ° F ) .
From July to September 1989 , " Voyager 2 " discovered six new moons of Neptune .
Of these , the lumpy-shaped Proteus is the biggest known object that has not been shaped into a sphere by its own gravity .
Although it is the second most massive Neptunian moon , it has only one quarter of one percent of the mass of Triton .
Neptune 's closest four moons , Naiad , Thalassa , Despina , and Galatea , orbit close enough to be inside Neptune 's rings .
The next farthest out , Larissa was originally discovered in 1981 when it had occulted a star .
The moon was credited for causing Neptune 's ring arcs when " Voyager 2 " observed Neptune in 1989 .
Five new unusual moons discovered between 2002 and 2003 were announced in 2004 .
Neptune can not be seen with naked eye alone , since Neptune 's normal brightness are between magnitudes + 7.7 and + 8.0 , which can be out-shined by Jupiter 's Galilean moons , the dwarf planet Ceres , and the asteroids 4 Vesta , 2 Pallas , 7 Iris , 3 Juno and 6 Hebe .
A telescope or strong binoculars will show Neptune as a small blue dot , similar in appearance to Uranus .
Its small obvious size has made it difficult to study visually ; most telescopic data was quite limited until the arrival of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics .
Neptune 's atmosphere is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium .
It also contains small amounts of methane which makes the planet appear blue .
Neptune once had a huge storm known as the " Great Dark Spot " which was discovered in 1989 by Voyager 2 . <SEP> In 1989 , the Great Dark Spot , a cyclonic storm system the size of Eurasia , was discovered by NASA 's " Voyager 2 " spacecraft .
The atmosphere of Neptune is made up mostly of hydrogen , with a smaller amount of helium .
A tiny amount of methane is also detected in the atmosphere .
Important absorption bands of methane happen at wavelengths above 600 nm , in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum .
This absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane gives Neptune its blue hue .
There is likely to be a core , thought to be about 15 Earth masses , made up of molten rock and metal surrounded by a mixture of rock , water , ammonia , and methane .
The atmosphere , extending about 10 to 20 % of the way towards the center , is mostly hydrogen and helium at high altitudes .
More mixtures of methane , ammonia , and water are found in the lower areas of the atmosphere .
One difference between Neptune and Uranus is the level of meteorological activity that has been observed ( seen or measured ) .
The weather of Neptune has extremely active storm systems .
Instead , a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in the planet 's northern hemisphere .
Its nickname was given when it was first noticed in the months leading up to the " Voyager " encounter in 1989 : it moved faster than the Great Dark Spot .
The Wizard 's Eye / " Dark Spot 2 " is another southern cyclonic storm , the second most strongest storm seen during the 1989 encounter .
It originally was completely dark , but as " Voyager " came closer to the planet , a bright core developed and is seen in most of the highest resolution images .
In 1846 , Urbain Le Verrier , who was not working with Adams , made his own calculations but also failed to get much attention from French astronomers .
After much delay , Challis began his unwilling search in July 1846 .
Meanwhile , Le Verrier had convinced Johann Gottfried Galle to search for the planet .
Although Heinrich d 'Arrest was still a student at the Berlin Observatory , he suggested that a newly drawn map of the sky , in the region of Le Verrier 's predicted area , could be compared with the current sky to look for the change of position of a planet , as compared to a fixed star .
Neptune was then discovered that very night on September 23 , 1846 , within 1 ° ( one degree ( angle ) of where Le Verrier had predicted it to be , and about 10 ° from Adams ' prediction .
Challis later found out that he had seen the planet twice in August , failing to recognize it owing to his careless approach to the work .
At 10.243 × 10 kg , Neptune 's mass puts the planet between Earth and the largest gas giants ; Neptune has seventeen Earth masses but just 1/18th the mass of Jupiter .
Neptune and Uranus are often considered to be part of a sub-class of gas giant known as " " ice giants " " , given their smaller size and big differences in composition compared to Jupiter and Saturn . <SEP> Uranus and Neptune are not exactly the same type of gas giants like to Jupiter and Saturn , but are rather ice giants , meaning they have a larger solid core and are also made of ices .
Unlike other gas giants , Neptune 's atmosphere shows the presence of high clouds making shadows on a thick cloud deck below .
Pictures from " Voyager 2 " in 1989 solved the problem , when the ring system was found to have several faint rings .
The farthest ring , Adams , has three famous arcs now named " Liberte ́ " , " Egalite ́ " , and " Fraternite ́ " ( Liberty , Equality , and Fraternity ) .
The existence of arcs is very hard to understand because the laws of motion would predict that arcs spread out into a single ring in a very short time .
The gravitational effects of Galatea , a moon just inward from the ring , are now thought to have created the arcs .

In July 1780 , he asked for , and got , command of West Point in order to surrender it to the British . <SEP> On 3 August 1780 , Arnold obtained command of West Point .
Arnold 's scheme was exposed when American forces captured British Major John Andre ́ carrying papers that revealed the plot .
On 15 August he received a coded letter from Andre ́ with Clinton 's final offer : £ 20,000 , and no indemnification for his losses .
Due to difficulties in getting the messages across the lines , neither side knew for some days that the other was in agreement to that offer .
On 25 August Peggy finally delivered to him Clinton 's agreement to the terms .
After the British withdrew from Philadelphia in June 1778 Washington appointed Arnold military commander of the city .
Even before the Americans reoccupied Philadelphia , Arnold began planning to capitalize financially on the change in power there , engaging in a variety of business deals designed to profit from war-related supply movements and benefiting from the protection of his authority .
These schemes were sometimes frustrated by powerful local politicians , who eventually amassed enough evidence to publicly air charges .
Arnold demanded a court martial to clear the charges , writing to Washington in May 1779 , " Having become a cripple in the service of my country , I little expected to meet such ungrateful returns " .
During the summer of 1778 Arnold met Peggy Shippen , the 18-year-old daughter of Judge Edward Shippen , a Loyalist sympathizer who had done business with the British while they occupied the city . <SEP> Peggy had been courted by British Major John Andre ́ during the British occupation of Philadelphia .
Peggy and Arnold married on 8 April 1779 .
Peggy and her circle of friends had found methods of staying in contact with paramours across the battle lines , in spite of military bans on communication with the enemy .
Arnold learned of Andre ́ 's capture the following morning , 24 September , when he received Jameson 's message that Andre ́ was in his custody and that the papers Andre ́ was carrying had been sent to General Washington . <SEP> Arnold received Jameson 's letter while waiting for Washington , with whom he had planned to have breakfast .
He made all haste to the shore and ordered bargemen to row him downriver to where the " Vulture " was anchored , which then took him to New York .
From the ship Arnold wrote a letter to Washington , requesting that Peggy be given safe passage to her family in Philadelphia , a request Washington granted .
When presented with evidence of Arnold 's betrayal , it is reported that Washington was calm .
He did , however , investigate the extent of the betrayal , and suggested in negotiations with General Clinton over the fate of Major Andre ́ that he was willing to exchange Andre ́ for Arnold .
This suggestion Clinton refused ; after a military tribunal , Andre ́ was hanged at Tappan , New York on 2 October .
Washington also infiltrated men into New York in an attempt to kidnap Arnold ; this plan , which very nearly succeeded , failed when Arnold changed living quarters prior to sailing for Virginia in December .
Arnold attempted to justify his actions in an open letter titled " To the Inhabitants of America " , published in newspapers in October 1780 .
In the letter to Washington requesting safe passage for Peggy , he wrote that " Love to my country actuates my present conduct , however it may appear inconsistent to the world , who very seldom judge right of any man 's actions . "
In January 1801 Arnold 's health began to decline .
Gout , which he had suffered since 1775 , attacked his unwounded leg to the point where he was unable to go to sea ; the other ached constantly , and he walked only with a cane .
His doctors diagnosed him as having dropsy , and a visit to the countryside only temporarily improved his condition .
He died after four days of delirium , on 14 June 1801 , at the age of 60 .
May God forgive me for ever having put on another , " but this may be apocryphal .
His funeral procession had " seven mourning coaches and four state carriages " ; the funeral was without military honors .

At the Wannsee Conference on January 20 , 1942 , the Nazis officially decided to kill all of the Jews in Europe ( 11 million people ) .
Some would be worked to death . <SEP> Others would be killed in extermination camps ( death camps ) .
At first , the " Einsatzgruppen " were sent to fight partisans – people in Nazi-occupied territories who continued to fight back against the Nazis .
However , by 1944 , most " Einsatzgruppen " had become part of Waffen-SS fighting units or sent to guard death camps .
In 1939 , Hitler decided to invade Poland .
Adolf Hitler said : " ... there must be no Polish leaders ; where Polish leaders exist they must be killed . "
The Einzatsgruppen followed this plan by killing about 65,000 civilians by the end of 1939 .
These people included Polish leaders , Jews , prostitutes , Roma people , and people with mental illnesses .

All of the main " Einsatzgruppen " took part in mass shootings from the beginning of the war .
However , by August , they were shooting all Jews , including women , children , infants , and the elderly .
When this became too slow , the " Einsatzkommandos " began to shoot larger groups next to , or even inside , mass graves .
As news about these killings spread , many Jewish people ran away .
The Nazis began to send people to concentration camps and ghettos . <SEP> Rural areas were mostly " Judenfrei " ( free of Jews ) .
The Nazis created forced labour gangs so they could make use of the Jews as slaves until the Nazis had killed them all .
After a while , Himmler realized that the " Einsatzgruppen "'s methods were not the best way to kill people as quickly and cheaply as possible . <SEP> He also found that many " Einsatzgruppen " had trouble killing so many people .
Some had physical and mental health problems , and others became alcoholics .
Himmler made a final decision after watching a mass execution in August 1941 . <SEP> He decided that shooting Jews was too stressful for his men .
Starting in 1942 , all of the main " Einsatzgruppen " began killing people using gas vans , which had been used to kill people with disabilities early on in Action T4 .
However , by September 1941 , Nazis at Auschwitz concentration camp had begun experimenting with Zyklon B , a cyanide-like pesticide .

Harry James Potter is the main character in J. K. Rowling 's " Harry Potter " fantasy series .
The books cover seven years in the life of the orphan who , on his 11th birthday , learns he is a wizard and the son of magical parents Lily and James Potter .
He goes to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn magic .
Harry soon learns that he is already famous in the world of wizards . <SEP> He also learns that his fate is connected to Lord Voldemort .
Rowling said that the idea for the Harry Potter character came to her while waiting for a train in 1990 . <SEP> According to author J. K. Rowling , the idea for both the " Harry Potter " books and the character came while waiting for a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990 .
She decided to make him an orphan following the death of her mother . <SEP> Rowling also decided to make Harry an orphan at a boarding school called Hogwarts .
J.K. Rowling said that in the hours she waited , her idea for " this scrawny , black-haired , bespectacled boy who did n't know he was a wizard became more and more real to me . "
She explained , " Harry HAD to be an orphan - so that he 's a free agent , with no fear of letting down his parents , disappointing them ... Hogwarts HAS to be a boarding school - half the important stuff happens at night !
Harry first appears in " Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone " ( published in the United States as " Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone " ) as the book 's protagonist , or main character .
When Harry was a little over one year old , his parents were killed by the powerful Dark Wizard , Lord Voldemort .
Harry survived Voldemort 's Killing Curse after his mother died to protect him .
The Curse was turned back at Voldemort and ripped his soul from his body .
Because of this , Harry has a lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead .
Rowling has said that creating the story about Harry Potter 's past was a matter of reverse planning : " The basic idea is that Harry ... did n't know he was a wizard ... and so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be , that he would n't know what he was ... When he was one-year-old , the most evil wizard in hundreds of years attempted to kill him .
He killed Harry 's parents , and then he tried to kill Harry - he tried to curse him ... Harry has to find out , before we find out .
And - so - but for some mysterious reason , the curse did n't work on Harry .
Harry is written as an orphan living unhappily with his only family left , the cruel Dursleys .
On his eleventh birthday , Harry finds that he is a wizard when Rubeus Hagrid tells him that he is to go Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry .
There he learns about his parents and his connection to the Dark Lord .
He is " sorted " into Gryffindor House by the Sorting Hat and becomes friends with classmates Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger .
He also forms rivalries with characters Draco Malfoy , a classmate from an elitist wizard family , and the Potions teacher and head of Slytherin House , Severus Snape .
Both feuds continue throughout the series .
In a 1999 interview , Rowling stated that Draco is based on several schoolyard bullies she had known and Snape on a teacher of hers who abused his power .
To defeat Harry , Voldemort steals the Elder Wand from Dumbledore 's tomb . <SEP> It is the most powerful wand ever created , and he twice casts the Killing Curse on Harry with it .
The first attempt merely stuns Harry into a deathlike state .
In the chapter " King 's Cross " , Dumbledore 's spirit tells Harry that when Voldemort failed to kill baby Harry and disembodied himself , Harry became an unintentional Horcrux ; Voldemort could not kill Harry while the Dark Lord 's soul shard was within Harry 's body .
Voldemort 's second Killing Curse also fails because Voldemort used Harry 's blood in his resurrection . <SEP> In the book 's climax , the Elder Wand disobeys the Dark Lord 's command and rebounds the curse onto Voldemort , killing him .
Voldemort 's soul shard within Harry was destroyed because Harry willingly faced death .
In the next chapter , " The Flaw in the Plan " , it is established that Harry , not Voldemort , became the Elder Wand 's true master .
J.K. Rowling said , the difference between Harry and Voldemort is that Harry willingly accepts mortality , making him stronger than his nemesis .
Throughout the series , Rowling wrote Harry Potter as a gifted wizard apprentice .
From the fourth book onwards , Rowling admits Harry has become quite talented in the Defence Against the Dark Arts and would beat his friend Hermione in a magical duel .
Harry is able to speak and understand Parseltongue , a language associated with Dark Magic , which , according to Rowling , is because he harbours a piece of Lord Voldemort 's soul .
After Voldemort destroys that soul piece in the seventh book 's climax , Harry loses the ability to speak Parseltongue .
By the end of " Deathly Hallows " , Harry possesses all three Deathly Hallows : the Cloak of Invisibility , the Resurrection Stone , and the Elder Wand , They are three of the most powerful magical items in all of the wizarding-world .
However , Harry lost the Resurrection Stone inside the Forbidden Forest , and decides to leave it there .
The death of her mother on 30 December 1990 led Rowling led to write Harry Potter as a boy longing for his dead parents . <SEP> His pain became " more deeper , more real " than in earlier versions because she related to it herself .
In a 2000 interview with " The Guardian " , Rowling also said that the character of Wart in T.H. White 's novel " The Sword in the Stone " is " Harry 's spiritual ancestor . "
She also said that Harry was born on 31 July and has the same birthday as herself .
However , she says , Harry is not directly based on any real-life character , " he came just out of a part of me " .
In the books , Harry is categorised as a " half-blood " wizard in the series , because although both his parents were magical , his mother , Lily Evans , was " Muggle-born " .
In the novels , Harry is the only child of James and Lily Potter , but orphaned as an infant .
Harry 's aunt and uncle kept the truth about their deaths from Harry , telling him they died in a car accident .
When Harry 's parents were murdered by Lord Voldemort , they left behind a large pile of wizard 's gold , used as currency in the world of magic , in a vault in the wizarding bank , Gringotts .
Another valued and useful possession is Harry 's Cloak of Invisibility .
After Sirius ' death , all of his remaining possessions were passed along to Harry .
Harry also inherited the remainder of Sirius ' wealth in wizard 's gold at Gringotts .

The bird flu virus H3N2 is endemic in pigs in China .
Pigs can carry human influenza viruses .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , a United States government agency , reports that the symptoms and transmission of the swine flu from human to human is much like seasonal flu .
It is believed to be spread between humans when an infected person coughs or sneezes and then touches something . <SEP> Another person then might touch the same thing with the virus on it and then touch their own nose or mouth .
The swine flu in humans is most contagious during the first five days of the illness although some people , most commonly children , can be contagious for up to ten days .
Diagnosis can be made by sending a specimen ( sample ) , collected during the first five days , to the CDC for analysis .
However , for the 2009 outbreak , it is recommended it be treated with oseltamivir and zanamivir .
The virus has evolved in recent decades .
In the cases more difficult to treat , special vaccines are produced .
Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus , the presence of non-reactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests that current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses .
She said that the virus is resistant to amantadine and rimantadine , but susceptible to oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ) and zanamivir ( Relenza ) .

The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame was named after him . <SEP> The Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame in Springfield , Massachusetts , is named in Naismith 's honor .
By the turn of the century , there were enough college teams in the east of the U.S. that the first games between different colleges could be played .
Although his sport continuously grew , Naismith long regarded his game as a curiosity and preferred gymnastics and wrestling as better forms of physical education .
However , basketball became a demonstration sport at the 1904 Games in St. Louis , USA .
As the Basketball Hall of Fame reports , Naismith was not interested in self-promotion nor in the glory of competitive sports .
Instead , he was more interested in his physical education career , receiving an honorary PE Masters degree in 1910 , patrolled the Mexican border for four months in 1916 during World War I , travelled to France , published two books ( " A Modern College " in 1911 and " Essence of a Healthy Life " in 1918 ) and became an American citizen in 1925 .

Naismith Hall , a college residential dormitory , is located on the northeastern edge of 19th Street and Naismith Drive .
On June 20 , 1894 , Naismith married Maude E. Sherman from Springfield .
The couple had five children : Margaret Mason ( 1895 ) , Helen Carolyn ( 1897 ) , John Edwin ( 1900 ) , Maude Ann ( 1904 ) and James Sherman ( 1913 ) .

The University of Kansas started a men 's basketball program in 1898 , following Naismith 's arrival . <SEP> This was only six years after Naismith had invented the game .
Naismith was employed as chapel director and physical education instructor .
In these early days , most basketball games were played against nearby YMCA teams . <SEP> The YMCA 's across the nation played a very important part in the birth of basketball .
With Naismith as coach , the team played only three current Big 12 schools : Nebraska ( six times ) , Missouri ( twice ) , and Kansas State ( once ) .
However , Naismith coached Forrest " Phog " Allen , who took over as coach at Kansas .
When Allen became a coach himself and told him that he was going to coach basketball at Baker University in 1904 , Naismith said to him : " You ca n't coach basketball ; you just play it . "
Allen began a coaching career that would lead him to be known as " the Father of Basketball Coaching . "
The three coaches have joined Naismith as members of the Basketball Hall of Fame .
In 1898 , Naismith became the first college basketball coach of the University of Kansas basketball team .
His record of 55 wins and 60 losses , means he became the only Kansas coach to have a losing record .
Nevertheless , Naismith has one of the greatest coaching legacies in basketball history , as he coached Basketball Hall of Fame coach Phog Allen , who himself coached Hall of Fame coaches Dean Smith , Adolph Rupp , and Ralph Miller at the University of Kansas .

Mandaeism or Mandaeanism ( Mandaic : Mandaiuta , " Manda ̄ ' iyya " ) is a monotheistic religion . <SEP> The religion has a strong dualistic world view .
Its followers , the Mandaeans , think highly of Adam , Abel , Seth , Enosh , Noah , Shem , Aram and especially John the Baptist .
Apart from the priests , very few people know it .
The " Genza ̄ Rabba ̄ " is divided into two halves — the " Genza ̄ Sma ̄ la ̄ " or " Left Ginza " and the " Genza ̄ Yemina ̄ " or " Right Ginza " .
Jorunn J. Buckley looked at these special marks the copyists left in the Left Ginza .
These special marks show that the Mandaeans existed during the late Arsacid period at the very latest .
According to this legend , the Mandaeans left Palestine after the destruction of Jerusalem in the 1st century AD and settled inside the Arsacid empire .
Although the Ginza continued to evolve under the rule of the Sassanians and the Islamic empires , few textual traditions can lay claim to such extensive continuity .
According to the " Fihrist " of ibn al-Nadim , Mani , the founder of Manichaeism , was brought up within the Elkasaites ( " Elcesaites " or " Elchasaite " ) sect .

This would imply that Mani had access to Mandaean religious literature .
Other groups which have been identified with the Mandaeans include the " Nasoraeans " , described by Epiphanius , and the Dositheans , mentioned by Theodore Bar Ko ̄ ni ̄ in his " Scholion " .
The Vampire Squid is an extreme example of a deep-sea cephalopod . <SEP> People think it lives at aphotic ( lightless ) depths from 600 – 900 metres ( 2,000-3,000 feet ) or more .
Within this region of the world 's oceans is a discrete habitat known as the oxygen minimum zone ( OMZ ) .
Within the OMZ oxygen saturation is too low to support aerobic metabolism in most higher organisms .
Nonetheless , the Vampire Squid is able to live normally in the OMZ at oxygen saturations as low as 3 % ; something no other cephalopod — and few other animals — can do .
Like other deep-sea cephalopods , Vampire Squid have no ink sacs .
If threatened , instead of ink , a sticky cloud of bioluminescent mucus containing innumerable orbs of blue light is ejected from the arm tips .
This luminous barrage , which may last nearly 10 minutes , is presumably meant to daze would-be predators and allow the Vampire Squid to disappear into the blackness without the need to swim far .
The display is made only if the animal is very agitated .
Their development goes through three forms : the very young animals have a single pair of fins , an intermediate form has two pairs , and the mature form again has one .
As the animals grow and their surface area to volume ratio drops , the fins are resized and repositioned in order to maximize gait efficiency .
This unique ontogeny caused confusion in the past , with the varying forms identified as several species in distinct families ( Young 2002 ) .
Little else is known regarding their feeding habits .
Vampire Squid have been found among the stomach contents of large deepwater fish , deep diving whales and pinnipeds such as sea lions .

The games took place from April 6 to April 15 , 1896 . <SEP> The International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) was also instituted during this congress .
As Ancient Greece was the birthplace of the Olympic Games , Athens was an appropriate choice to stage the inaugural modern Games .
Other elements of current Olympic opening ceremonies were started later : the Olympic flame was first lit in 1928 , the first athletes ' oath was sworn at the 1920 Summer Olympics , and the first officials ' oath was taken at the 1972 Olympic Games .

The Commonwealth of Australia is a federal constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy .
The Commonwealth of Australia was formed in 1901 when the six self-governing British colonies , agreed to join together as one nation . <SEP> These colonies became the six states of Australia .
The written agreement is the Australian Constitution . <SEP> This was written at a Constitutional Convention and voted for by the people of the colonies .
Section 1 of the Australian Constitution sets up a democratic legislature , the bicameral Parliament of Australia . <SEP> This is the Queen and two houses , the Senate and the House of Representatives .
Section 51 of the Constitution sets out the Commonwealth Government 's legislative powers and gives certain powers and responsibilities ( known as " heads of power " ) to the federal government .
All remaining responsibilities are kept by the six States .
Each State has its own constitution , so that Australia has seven sovereign Parliaments , none of which can take over the powers of any other .
The High Court of Australia rules on any arguments between the Commonwealth and the States , or among the States , about their powers .
Before the Australia Act 1986 , and matching legislation in the parliament of the United Kingdom , some Australian cases could be sent to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for final appeal .
The possibility of the British Parliament making laws to overturn the Australian Constitution was also removed .
The Legislature makes the laws , and supervises the activities of the other two arms with a view to changing the laws if needed .
The Australian Parliament is bicameral , made up of the Queen , a 76-member Senate and a 150-member House of Representatives .
Twelve Senators from each state are elected for six-year terms , using proportional representation and the single transferable vote ( known in Australia as " preferential voting " , with half elected every three years .
There are also two senators elected by voters from the Northern Territory ( and including the Indian Ocean Territories , Christmas Island and the Cocos ( Keeling ) Islands ) . <SEP> Another two senators are elected by the voters of the Australian Capital Territory ( including the Jervis Bay Territory ) .
Senators from the territories are also elected using preferential voting , however , their term of office is not fixed : it starts on the day of a general election for the House of Representatives and ends the day before the next such election day .
The Prime Minister and the Cabinet are responsible to the Parliament , of which they must be members .
The Prime Minister can advise the Governor-General to call an election for the House of Representatives at any time , but Senate elections can only be held within certain periods set out in the Constitution .
When the Labor first held office under Chris Watson , Watson used the right to choose members of his Cabinet .
In 1907 , however , the party decided that future Labor Cabinets would be elected by the members of the Parliamentary Labor Party , the Caucus .
The Labor Prime Ministers had a lot of influence over who was elected to Labor ministries , although the leaders small groups inside the party also had a lot of power .
Prior to the 2007 general election , Kevin Rudd , said that he and he alone would choose the ministry if he become Prime Minister .
The federal nature of the Commonwealth and the structure of the Parliament of Australia were the subject of long negotiations among the colonies .
The House of Representatives is elected on a basis which shows the different sized populations of the States .
So New South Wales has 50 members while Tasmania has only five .
But the Senate is elected on a basis of equality among the States : all States have 12 Senators , regardless of population .
This was so the Senators of the smaller States could form a majority and change or even reject laws from the House of Representatives .
The ACT and the NT elect two senators each .
The members of the House of Representatives are elected by preferential voting from single-member areas spread among the states and territories roughly in proportion to population .
In ordinary legislation , the two chambers have the same powers , but all laws for spending money or charging taxes must come from the House of Representatives .
In the Westminster system , the leader of the political party or group of parties that holds the support of a majority of the members in the House of Representatives is asked to form a government and is named Prime Minister .
The Australian Constitution was written in 1901 , when the Dominions of the British Empire were not independent countries , and does not use the words " head of state " .
In practice , the role of head of state of Australia is divided between two people , the Queen of Australia and the Governor-General of Australia . <SEP> The Governor- General is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister of Australia .
Though in many respects the Governor-General is the Queen 's representative , and exercises various constitutional powers in her name , they are also independently vested with many important constitutional powers by the Constitution .
The Federal Executive Council consists of the Governor-General , the Prime Minister and Ministers . <SEP> It is a formal body which exists to give legal effect to decisions made by the Cabinet , and to carry out various other functions .
Members of the Executive Council are entitled to be styled " The Honourable " , a title which they retain for life .
The Governor-General usually presides at Council meetings , but a Minister with the title Vice-President of the Executive Council serves as the link between the government and the Council .
The Constitution of Australia does not mention the Cabinet , and its decisions have no legal force .
All members of the ministry must be sworn as members of the Federal Executive Council .
This council is chaired by the Governor-General and which meets solely to approve and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet .
That is why there is always a member of the ministry holding the title Vice-President of the Executive Council .
The theme park sits on what used to be a berry farm that was built by Walter Knott , Cordelia Knott , and their family .
Starting around 1920 , the family started selling berries , berry preserves , and pies from a roadside stand along a highway .

This period was characterized by remarkable success in technology , trade and culture ; many of the masterpieces of Spain were constructed in this period , including the famous Great Mosque of Co ́ rdoba .
The rule of the Caliphate is known as the heyday of Muslim presence in the Iberian peninsula , before it split into taifas .
The Shiʕa Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah of the Fatimid dynasty , which claimed descendency of Muhammad through his daughter , claimed the title of Caliph in 909 , creating a separate line of caliphs in North Africa .
Initially covering Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia and Libya , the Fatimid caliphs extended their rule for the next 150 years , taking Egypt and Palestine , before the Abbassid dynasty was able to turn the tide , limiting Fatimid rule to Egypt .
The Umayyad dynasty , which had survived and come to rule over the Muslim provinces of Spain , reclaimed the title of Caliph in 929 , lasting until it was overthrown in 1031 .
Ottoman rulers were known primarily by the title of Sultan and sometimes also used the title of Caliph .
As the Ottoman Empire grew in size and strength , Ottoman rulers beginning with Selim I began to claim Caliphal authority .
Muawiyah , a relative of Uthman , and governor " ( Wali ) " of Syria became one of Ali 's challengers .
Under him , the caliphate became a hereditary office for the first time .
He founded the Umayyad dynasty .
Under the Umayyads the Caliphate grew rapidly geographically . <SEP> The Umayyad Caliphate emerged as the rulers of the Islamic world .

A tree is a tall plant with a trunk and branches made of wood .
Trees can live for many years .
The four main parts of a tree are the roots , the trunk , the branches , and the leaves .
A single tree has many roots .
The trunk is covered with bark which protects it from damage .
Above ground , the trunk gives height to the leaf-bearing branches , competing with other plant species for sunlight .
It is also only possible for trees which are solid to the center of the tree ; many very old trees become hollow as the dead heartwood decays away .
Trees with leaves all year round are evergreens , and those that shed their leaves are deciduous .
A small group of trees growing together is called a grove or copse , and a landscape covered by a dense growth of trees is called a forest .
A very young tree is called a sapling .

This can get particularly interesting when the auditory information of one sound , paired with the spoken lips of another sound , ultimately combine to form the perception of a third different sound .
The McGurk effect is robust : that is , it still works even if a person know about it .
This is different from some optical illusions , which do not work anymore once a person can see it .
Obviously you can not ask the infant what they hear since they can not verbally communicate yet but by measuring certain variables such as their attention to audiovisual stimuli , effects similar to the McGurk effect can be seen .
Very soon after infants are born , sometimes even within minutes of birth , they are able to imitate adult facial movements ; an important first step in audiovisual speech perception . <SEP> Next comes the ability to recognize lip movements and speech sounds a couple of weeks after birth .
Evidence of the McGurk effect is not visible though until about 4 months of age , with a much stronger presence at around 5 months after birth .
Once the stimuli gets changed , the infant exhibits an effect similar to the McGurk effect . <SEP> As infants grow older and continue to develop , the McGurk effect also becomes more prominent as visual cues start to override purely auditory information in audiovisual speech perception .
Two researchers by the name of Wareham and Wright conducted a study in 2005 that may suggest that the McGurk effect can influence how everyday speech is perceived .

An ovum ( Latin : " egg " , plural : ova ) is the name for the haploid female reproductive cell , or gamete .
When the ovum is fertilised by a male 's sperm , it becomes a zygote , which develops into a new organism .
The ovum is fertilized inside the female body , and the embryo then develops inside the uterus , being fed by the mothers placenta .
The archegonium has a long ' neck ' with the egg cell inside .
When the egg is mature , the neck opens and sperm swims in to fertilize the egg .
In flowering plants , the female gametes are made of only eight cells , called the embryo sac , inside the ovule .
The cell closest to the opening of the embryo sac becomes the egg cell .
When pollinated , sperm swims into the embryo sac and fertilizes the egg .
The zygote then develops into an embryo inside the ovule .
It allows plants to absorb and use light .
It absorbs light most strongly in the blue portion of the electromagnetic spectrum , followed by the red portion . <SEP> Chlorophyll molecules absorb in the blue and red bands , but not the green and infra-red bands .
However , it is a poor absorber of green and near-green portions of the spectrum .
Chlorophyll was first isolated in 1817 .
Chlorophyll Content meters measure the optical absorption of a leaf to estimate its chlorophyll content . <SEP> Chlorophyll content meters measure the amount of absorption at the red band to estimate the amount of chlorophyll present in the leaf .
Chlorophyll molecules are arranged in and around the membranes of chloroplasts .
The function of most chlorophyll ( up to several hundred molecules per photosystem ) is to absorb light and transfer that light energy to reaction centres .
These pigments are named after the wavelength ( in nanometers ) of their red-peak absorption maximum .
These chlorophyll pigments can be separated in a simple paper chromatography experiment .
The function of the reaction center chlorophyll is to use the energy transferred to it from the other chlorophyll pigments to undergo a specific redox reaction .
In this reaction the chlorophyll gives an electron to an electron transport chain .
Photosystem I typically works in series with Photosystem II .

Reconstructionists believe in practicing a religion that is from one culture .
Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism ( CR ) started in the 1980s , when people interested in the Celts and in Paganism were looking for an authentic religion .
Many CRs view each act of daily life as a form of ritual , and they accompany daily activities with traditional prayers , chants and songs from sources such as the Scottish Gaelic " Carmina Gadelica " or manuscript collections of ancient Irish or Welsh poetry .
Community rituals are usually based on traditional community celebrations found in folkloric collections by authors such as Marian McNeill , Kevin Danaher or John Gregorson Campbell .
More formal or mystical CR rituals are often based on traditional techniques of interacting with the Otherworld , such as the act of making offerings of food , drink and art to the spirits of the land , ancestral spirits , and the Celtic deities .

By July 1944 , Poland had been occupied by Nazi German troops for almost five years .
Germany was fighting a group of Allied powers , led by the Soviet Union , the United Kingdom and the United States .
The initial plan of the Home Army was to join with the invading forces of the Western Allies as they freed Europe from the Nazis .
Despite the loss of Wola , the Polish resistance got stronger . <SEP> Also the destruction of the main Polish resistance forces by the Germans helped the Soviet Union , since it significantly weakened any potential Polish opposition to the Soviet occupation .
" Zos ́ ka " and " Wacek " troops captured the Warsaw Ghetto and liberate the Ge ̨ sio ́ wka concentration camp , freeing about 350 Jews .
The area became one of the main communication links between the insurgents fighting in Wola and those defending the Old Town .
On 7 August German forces were strengthened by the arrival of tanks . <SEP> The Germans put Polish civilians in front of the tanks to act as human shields .
After two days of heavy fighting they managed to get through Wola and reach Bankowy Square .
However , by then the barricades , street fortifications , and tank obstacles were well-prepared . <SEP> Both sides reached a stalemate ( a situation in which no side could win ) , with violent house-to-house fighting .
According to many historians , the uprising failed because of a lack of outside support and the late arrival of the support which did arrive .
The Polish government in London tried to get support from the Western Allies before the start of battle . <SEP> The allies would not help without Soviet approval .
The Polish government in London asked the British several times to send allied troops to Poland , however , the British troops did not arrive until December 1944 .
Shortly after their arrival , the Soviet authorities arrested them .
From August 1943 to July 1944 , over 200 British Royal Air Force ( RAF ) flights dropped 146 Polish personnel trained in Great Britain , over 4000 containers of supplies , and $ 16 million in banknotes and gold to the Home Army .
At 17:00 on 31 July , the Polish army decided to start the uprising at 17:00 on the following day .
The decision was a mistake because the poorly-equipped Polish forces were only prepared for night attacks .
Although many partisan groups were waiting throughout the city , the movement of thousands of young men and women was hard to hide .
Some fighting started before the official attack time , notably in Z ̇ oliborz , and around Napoleon Square and Da ̨ browski Square .
The Germans had realized that the Poles might attack them .
That evening the Poles captured a major German weapons building , the main post office and power station , Praga railway station and the tallest building in Warsaw , the Prudential building .
However , Castle Square , the police district , and the airport were held by the Germans .
The Poles were most successful in the City Centre , Old Town , and Wola districts .
However , several major German strongholds remained , and in some areas of Wola the Poles had to retreat .
In other areas such as Mokoto ́ w , the Poles controlled only the residential areas .
In Praga , on the east bank of the Vistula , the Poles were sent back into hiding by a large number of German forces .
By 4 August most of the city was held by Polish forces .
By 13 September , the Germans had destroyed the remaining bridges over the Vistula .
Three patrols of his First Polish Army landed in the Czerniako ́ w and Powis ́ le areas and joined with Home Army forces on the night of 14/15 September .
The artillery and air bombing provided by the Soviets did not stop enemy machine-gun fire as the Poles crossed the river , and the landing troops had heavy losses .
Only part of the main units made it ashore ( I and III battalions of 9th infantry regiment , 3rd Infantry Division ) .
The landings by the 1st Polish Army were the only outside ground force which arrived to support the uprising .
When Stalin and Churchill met in October 1944 , Stalin told Churchill that the lack of Soviet support was due to Soviet losses in the Vistula area .
The Germans thought it was their defence of Warsaw that prevented the Soviet advance .
The Germans published propaganda which said that both the British and Soviets did not help the Poles .
The Soviet units which reached the edges of Warsaw in the final days of July 1944 had advanced from the 1st Belorussian Front in Western Ukraine .
The Germans were trying to send new troops to hold the line of the Vistula . <SEP> This was the last major river barrier between the Red Army and Germany .
The Germans sent in many infantry units of poor quality , and 4 – 5 high quality Panzer Divisions in the 39th Panzer Corps and 4th SS Panzer Corps .
By the first week of September both German and Polish commanders realized that the Soviet army was not going to attack and break the stalemate .
The Germans thought that a longer insurgency would make it hard to hold Warsaw as the frontline . <SEP> The Poles were worried that continued resistance would lead to many deaths .
On 7 September , General Rohr proposed to talk , which Bo ́ r-Komorowski agreed to discuss the following day .
Over 8 , 9 and 10 September about 20,000 civilians were allowed to leave the city . <SEP> Rohr recognized the right of Home Army insurgents to be treated as fighters .
The Poles stopped talks on the 11th , as they received news that the Soviets were advancing through Praga .
A few days later , the arrival of the 1st Polish gave the resistance confidence and the talks stopped .
However , by the morning of 27 September , the Germans had recaptured Mokoto ́ w .
In the evening of 30 September , Z ̇ oliborz was captured by the Germans .
The Poles were being pushed into a smaller area and they were at risk of being killed .
Bo ́ r-Komorowski was promoted to commander-in-chief , even though he was trapped in Warsaw .
Bo ́ r-Komorowski and Prime Minister Mikołajczyk again asked Rokossovky and Stalin for Soviet help .
According to Soviet Marshal Georgy Zhukov , who was by this time at the Vistula front , both he and Rokossovsky advised Stalin against an attack because of heavy Soviet losses .
The facts of the Warsaw Uprising were a problem for Stalin . <SEP> The facts were changed in propaganda of the People 's Republic of Poland , which emphasized the failings of the Home Army and the Polish government-in-exile .
In the post-war period , the name of the Home Army was banned , and most films and novels covering the 1944 Uprising were either banned or modified so that the name of the Home Army did not appear .
It was suggested that Stalin benefited from Soviet failure to help . <SEP> The opposition to eventual Soviet control of Poland was eliminated when the Nazis killed the partisans .
The belief that the Uprising failed because of the Soviet Union contributed to anti-Soviet feelings in Poland .
Most alloys are made by melting the metals , mixing them while they are liquid to form a solution , then leaving them to cool and turn solid again .
For example , steel is an alloy made from iron but it is stronger than iron .
Physical properties like density , reactivity and electrical and thermal ( heat ) conductivity may not be much different than the elements ( substances ) which make the alloy .
Bronze is made from copper and tin . <SEP> Brass is another alloy made from copper and zinc .
Then , bronze was being used for making tools and weapons .
Now , bronze is used for making ornaments , statues , and bells .
An alloy is a uniform mixture .
It is made up of two or more chemical elements , of which at least one is a metal .
The term alloy means a mixture of atoms in which the main substance or the primary constituent is a metal .
This primary metal is called the " base " or " matrix " .
If an alloy has only two types of atoms , like copper-nickel alloy , then such an alloy is called " binary alloy " .
If an alloy has three types of atoms , like iron , nickel and chromium , then it is called a " ternary alloy " .
An alloy with four types of atoms is called a " quaternary alloy " and an alloy with five types of atoms is called a " quinary alloy " .
The whole range of possible varieties of an alloy is called a " system " .
All the forms of alloy having only two constituents are called a " binary system " . <SEP> All forms of an alloy having three constituents are called a " ternary system " .

Gastropods , or " univalves " , are the largest and most successful class of molluscs .
Most of are marine , but many live in freshwater or on land . <SEP> The best-known gastropods are land slugs and snails , but more than half of all species live in a marine environment .
Their fossil record goes back to the later Cambrian .
Most members have a shell , which is in one piece and coiled or spiralled ; it usually opens on the right hand side ( viewed with the shell apex pointing up ) .
Some species have an operculum , a lid or trapdoor to close the shell .
In some , the slugs , the shell is absent , and the body is streamlined .
The radula is usually adapted to the food that a species eats .
The simplest gastropods are the limpets and abalones , both herbivores that use their hard radulas to rasp at seaweeds on rocks .
Many marine gastropods are burrowers and have siphons or tubes that extend from the mantle and sometimes the shell .
The siphons are also used to detect prey from a distance .
These gastropods breathe with gills . <SEP> Some freshwater species and almost all terrestric species have developed lungs .
Many lines living today evolved in the Mesozoic era , taking advantage of the huge supply of food on the sea floor .
Most of the gastropods of that era belong to primitive groups . <SEP> A few of these groups still survive today .
By the Carboniferous period many of the shapes seen in living gastropods can be matched in the fossil record . <SEP> Despite these similarities in appearance , the majority of these older forms are not directly related to living forms .
One of the earliest known terrestrial ( land-dwelling ) gastropods is " Maturipupa " which is found in the Coal Measures of the Carboniferous period in Europe . <SEP> Relatives of the modern land snails are rare before the Cretaceous period .

By the time the Great Plague ended , about 2.5 % of England 's population had died from the plague .
Historians think the plague spread to England from the Netherlands .
Dutch trading ships carrying cotton from Amsterdam may have brought the plague to England . <SEP> Amsterdam was badly hit by the plague in 1663 – 1664 ; the disease killed about 50,000 people .
In London , the first places hit by the plague were the dock areas outside of the city and the parish of St Giles in the Fields .
In these places , poor workers lived crowded together in bad conditions .
However , records say the first person to die of the plague in London was Rebecca Andrews , on 12 April 1665 .
By July 1665 , plague was in the city of London itself .
King Charles II of England , his family , and his court left the city for Oxfordshire .
Most wealthy merchants and professionals left the city , so most businesses were closed .
So did the Lord Mayor of London , Sir John Lawrence . <SEP> Henry Foe , a saddler who lived in East London , also decided not to leave the city .
As the plague got worse , more and more people left , but a small number of clergymen , physicians and apothecaries chose to stay .
Some of the people who stayed in London wrote about the Great Plague .
At the time , nobody understood what caused the plague , how it spread , or how to treat it .
In one parish in London , 1,114 dead plague victims were buried together in a hole that was fifty feet long and twenty feet wide .
A red cross and the words " Lord have mercy upon us " would be painted on the door .

Group theory is also useful in studying the symmetry of molecular orbitals . <SEP> This is used in the Hu ̈ ckel method , ligand field theory , and the Woodward – Hoffmann rules .
Another idea on a larger scale is the use of crystal systems to describe crystallographic symmetry in bulk materials .
Scientists find molecular symmetry by using X-ray crystallography and other forms of spectroscopy .
Spectroscopic notation is based on facts taken from molecular symmetry .
Eugene Wigner used group theory to explain the selection rules of atomic spectroscopy .
Robert Mulliken was the first to publish character tables in English ( 1933 ) . <SEP> E. Bright Wilson used them in 1934 to predict the symmetry of vibrational normal modes .
The symmetry of a molecule can be described by 5 types of symmetry elements .
Symmetry operations can be written in many ways .
A good way to write them is by using matrices .
For any vector representing a point in Cartesian coordinates , left-multiplying it gives the new place of the point transformed by the symmetry operation .
Composition of operations is done by matrix multiplication .
In the C example this is : Although an infinite ( going on forever ) number of such representations ( ways of showing things ) exist , the irreducible representations ( or " irreps " ) of the group are commonly used , as all other representations of the group can be described as a linear combination of the irreducible representations .

Joan Geraldine Bennett ( February 27 , 1910 – December 7 , 1990 ) was an Emmy-nominated American movie actress who appeared in more than 70 Hollywood movies from the silent era to talkies , from color to the advent of television and epic movies .
She may be best known and loved for her film noir movies femme fatale roles in movies by director Fritz Lang .
Her father was actor Richard Bennett , her mother , actress Adrienne Morrison , and her sisters , actress Constance Bennett and dancer , Barbara Bennett .
Joan first acted onstage with her father at age 18 and by 19 had become a movie star courtesy of her roles in such movies as " Bulldog Drummond " ( 1929 ) and " Disraeli " ( 1929 ) .
She moved quickly from movie to movie throughout the 1930s , appearing with John Barrymore in his version of " Moby Dick " ( 1930 ) and playing Amy to Katharine Hepburn 's Jo in " Little Women " ( 1933 ) .

The latter movie brought Bennett to the attention of producer Walter Wanger , who signed her to a contract and eventually ( in 1940 ) married her .
Wanger managed Bennett 's career , and with director Tay Garnett convinced her to change her hair from blonde ( her natural color ) to brunette .
With this change her screen persona evolved into that of a glamorous seductive , femme fatale and she began to attract attention in a series of highly acclaimed movie noirs by director Fritz Lang .

A Halkett boat is a type of lightweight inflatable boat . <SEP> The boat was first created by Lt Peter Halkett ( 1820 – 1885 ) during the 1840s .
Halkett had been interested in the problems of travelling in the Canadian Arctic . <SEP> He wanted to make a boat that was light enough to be carried over bad terrain , but strong enough to be used in very bad weather conditions .
He was the son of John Halkett , a director of the Hudson 's Bay Company who had lived in Canada for many years before returning to England . <SEP> Peter Halkett was interested in the exploration of the Canadian Arctic for a long time .

One person in the party built a small canoe from canvas and willow . <SEP> They had to cross the river one at a time using the canoe .
Halkett 's first design was a boat that was made using cloth combined with rubber .
Next , he created a two-man boat that was small enough to fit into a knapsack . <SEP> When it was deflated , It could be used as a waterproof blanket .
In early 1844 , Halkett tested the first boat-cloak on the River Thames . <SEP> He paddled it 15 km without taking on any water .

The boat-cloak was very well liked by explorers . <SEP> John Richardson ( who had almost died during the 1819 – 1822 Coppermine expedition ) wrote that " Had we been possessed of such a contrivance in our first expedition , I have little doubt of our having brought the whole party in safely " .
Because of how well the boat-cloak did during his tests , Halkett built a larger version . <SEP> This boat could be folted into a knapsack .
When inflated , it could carry two men .
On 8 May 1845 Lord Herbert , First Secretary to the Admiralty wrote to Halkett that " My Lords are of an opinion that your invention is extremely clever and ingenious , and that it might be useful in Exploring and Surveying Expeditions , but they do not consider that it would be made applicable for general purposes in the Naval Service " .
Although the Navy saw no use for Halkett 's boats in general naval service , this larger boat was liked very much by explorers .
John Franklin bought one to take on the 1845 expedition .
Franklin believed that Halkett boats were very needed to travel in Canada . <SEP> He gave the boat that was to be used for his expedition to Sir George Simpson , Governor-in-Chief of Rupert 's Land so that Simpson could use in his travels in the region .
He got another boat from Halkett to be used on his last expedition .
They were commercially unsuccessful .
Even though the boats were said to be very good for lake-fishing and duck-shooting and were shown in the Great Exhibition of 1851 , they did not sell well . <SEP> Halkett 's boat were not widely used except in the field of Canadian exploration .
Halkett died on 23 March 1885 , aged 65 , and the building of his boats stopped .
John Rae gave his boat from the 1853 expedition to a Miss Peace of Kirkwall .
Many years later it was found and is now in the Stromness Museum at Orkney .

Imry died in Tel Aviv on 29 May 2018 at the age of 79 .
In Mu ̈ llerian mimicry , some species with warning colouration come to look like each other .
Mu ̈ ller 's explanation was simple : " Both species benefit from a common pattern " .
This type of mimicry is quite common . <SEP> This is interesting because it shows this type of mimicry evolved long before flowering plants arose .
The Australian katydid " Chlorobalius leucoviridis " can attract male cicadas by imitating the species-specific reply clicks of sexually receptive female cicadas .
Playback experiments show that " C. leucoviridis " is able to attract males of many cicada species , even though cicada mating signals are species-specific .
Female fireflies of the genus " Photuris " emit the same light signals that females of other genera use as a mating signal .
Further research showed male fireflies from several different genera are attracted to these mimics , and are subsequently captured and eaten .
Luring is not a necessary condition however , as the predator may have a significant advantage by not being identified as such .
Some allow the cleaner to go inside their mouth to hunt these parasites .
One species of cleaner , the Bluestreak cleaner wrasse ( " Labroides dimidiatus " ) , shown to the right cleaning a grouper , lives in coral reefs in the Indian and Pacific Oceans .
It is recognized by other fish who allow it to clean them .
Its imposter , the mimetic Sabre-toothed blenny ( " Aspidontus taeniatus " ) , also lives in the Indian Ocean . <SEP> It not only looks like the wrasse in terms of size and colour , but even mimics the cleaner 's ' dance ' .
After fooling its prey into letting its guard down , the blenny then bites it , tearing off a piece of its fin before fleeing the scene .
Fish attacked in this manner soon learn to distinguish mimic from model , but because the similarity is close they become much more cautious of the model as well .
Due to victim 's ability to discriminate between foe and helper , the blennies have evolved close similarity , right down to the regional level .
A phenomenon sometimes called " auto-mimicry " is when the model belongs to the same species as the mimic .
An example is the Monarch butterfly " Danaus plexippus " , which feeds on milkweed plants .
The butterflies store toxins from the plant , which they maintain even in their adult forms .
As the levels of toxin vary depending on diet during the larval stage , some Monarchs will be more toxic than others .
Less palatable individuals can be thought of as mimics of the more dangerous individuals .
In species where one sex may be more of a threat than the other , if the two sexes look alike one can protect the other .
Evidence came from a monkey from Gabon , which regularly ate male moths of the genus " Anaphe " , but promptly stopped after it tasted a noxious female .

" Aurornis xui " may be the most basal ( " primitive " ) bird species known to date .
Aurornis was discovered in 2013 .
The animal may predate the famous " Archaeopteryx lithographica " , the earliest bird , by about 10 million years .

Furtwa ̈ ngler was born on January , 25 , 1886 in Berlin , Germany .
He grew up in Munich , where his father was an archaeologist and professor .
He wrote several pieces before he was 20 years old .
Furtwa ̈ ngler first started conducting as a young man . <SEP> He wanted to conduct in order to perform his own music .

For materials that can withstand heat , chemists often use high temperature methods .
For example , chemists use tube furnaces to prepare bulk solids . <SEP> This allows reactions to be conducted up to around 1100 ° C.
For higher temperatures up to 2000 ° C , chemists use special equipment such as ovens made with a tantalum tube through which an electric current is passed .
Chemists often melt the reactants together and then later anneal the solidified melt .
If volatile reactants are involved , the reactants are often put in an ampoule and then all air is removed .
Often , the chemists keep the reactant mixture cold ( for example , by keeping the bottom of the ampoule in liquid nitrogen ) and then seal the ampoule .
The sealed ampoule is then put in an oven and given a specified heat treatment .
These are often carried out by adding a small amount of a transport agent ( for example , iodine ) to a sealed ampoule .
This method can be used to obtain the product in the form of single crystals suitable for structure determination by X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) .
Chemists try changing the stoichiometry to find which stoichiometries will lead to new solid compounds or to solid solutions between known ones .
Powder diffraction will help the identification of known phases in the mixture .
If a pattern is found that is not known in the diffraction data libraries an attempt can be made to index the pattern , that is to identify the symmetry and the size of the unit cell .
( If the product is not crystalline the characterization is much more difficult . )
Once the unit cell of a new phase is known , the next step is to establish the ratio of the elements ( stoichiometry ) of the phase .
Sometimes the composition of the original mixture will give a clue , if one finds only one product ( a single powder pattern ) or if one was trying to make a phase of a certain composition by analogy to known materials .
But this is rare .
Often chemist work hard to improve the synthetic methodology to get a pure sample of the new material .
If chemists can separate the product from the rest of the reaction mixture , then chemists can use elemental analysis on the isolated product .
Other ways involve Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and the generation of characteristic X-rays in the electron beam .

A basic example is the weight given to sales versus airplay .
Initially , singles were the leading way by which people bought music .

In later decades , the recording industry concentrated more on album sales and musicians eventually released more full-length albums than singles , and by the 1990s many record companies stopped releasing singles ( see " Album Cuts " , below ) .

Artificial intelligence ( AI ) is the ability of a computer program or a machine to think and learn .
In general use , the term " artificial intelligence " means a machine which mimics human cognition .
Andreas Kaplan and Michael Haenlein define AI as a system ’ s ability to correctly interpret external data , to learn from such data , and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation .
As machines become increasingly capable , mental facilities once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition .
At present we use the term AI for successfully understanding human speech , competing at a high level in strategic game systems ( such as Chess and Go ) , self-driving cars , and interpreting complex data .
AI involves many different fields like computer science , mathematics , linguistics , psychology , neuroscience , and philosophy .
Borrowing from the management literature , Kaplan and Haenlein classify artificial intelligence into three different types of AI systems : analytical , human-inspired , and humanized artificial intelligence .
Analytical AI has only characteristics consistent with cognitive intelligence generating cognitive representation of the world and using learning based on past experience to inform future decisions .
Human-inspired AI has elements from cognitive as well as emotional intelligence , understanding , in addition to cognitive elements , also human emotions considering them in their decision making .
Humanized AI shows characteristics of all types of competencies ( i.e. , cognitive , emotional , and social intelligence ) , able to be self-conscious and self-aware in interactions with others .

Failure rate is the frequency with which an engineered system or component fails .
It is often written as the Greek letter λ ( lambda ) and is important in reliability theory .
Failure rate is usually time dependent , and an intuitive corollary is that the rate changes over time versus the expected life cycle of a system .
For example , as an automobile grows older , the failure rate in its fifth year of service may be many times greater than its failure rate during its first year of service – one simply does not expect to replace an exhaust pipe , overhaul the brakes , or have major transmission problems in a new vehicle .
Mean Time Between Failures ( MTBF ) is closely related to failure rate .
In the special case when the likelihood of failure remains constant with respect to time ( for example , in some product like a brick or protected steel beam ) , and ignoring the time to recover from failure , failure rate is simply the inverse of the Mean Time Between Failures ( MTBF ) .
MTBF is an important specification parameter in all aspects of high importance engineering design – such as naval architecture , aerospace engineering , automotive design , etc . – in short , any task where failure in a key part or of the whole of a system needs be minimized and severely curtailed , particularly where lives might be lost if such factors are not taken into account .

The ( ; ; Wade – Giles : ku-ch 'in ; literally " ancient stringed-instrument " ) is the modern name for a plucked seven-string Chinese musical instrument of the zither family .
It has been played since ancient times , and has traditionally been favored by educated people as an instrument of great beauty and refinement .
Traditionally the instrument was called simply qin 「 琴 」 , but by the 20th century the term had come to be used on many other musical instruments as well ( for example , the " yangqin " 「 揚琴 」 hammered dulcimer , the " huqin " 「 胡琴 」 family of bowed string instruments , and the Western piano ( ; literally " steel stringed-instrument " ) ) , so the prefix " gu- " 「 古 」 ( meaning " ancient " ) was added for clarification .
It can also be called qixianqin 「 七絃琴 」 ( " seven-stringed instrument " ) .
Because Robert Hans van Gulik 's famous book about the qin is called " The Lore of the Chinese Lute " , the qin is sometimes inaccurately called a lute .
Other incorrect classifications ( mainly from music CDs ) include " harp " or " table-harp " .
The qin is a very quiet instrument , with a range of about four octaves , and its open strings are tuned in the bass register ( its lowest pitch is about two octaves below middle C , or the lowest note on the cello ) .
Stopped sounds are special for the variety of slides and ornaments used , and the use of glissando ( sliding tones ) gives it a sound similar to a pizzicato cello or fretless bass guitar .
The modern form has been standardized from about two thousand years .
Legend has it that the qin , has a history of about 5,000 years ; that the legendary people of China 's pre-history ; Fuxi , Shennong and Huang Di ( the Yellow Emperor ) , was involved in its creation .
It is mentioned in Chinese writings dating back nearly 3,000 years , and related instruments have been found in tombs from about 2,500 years ago .
Chinese tradition says the qin originally had five strings , but then two were added about 1,000 BCE , making seven .
Later , in the Zhou dynasty , Zhou Wen Wang 周文王 added a sixth string to mourn his son , Bo Yihou 伯邑考 .
His successor , Zhou Wu Wang 周武王 , added a seventh string to motivate his troops into battle with the Shang .
The thirteen " hui " 『 徽 』 on the surface represent the 13 months of the year ( the extra 13th is the ' leap month ' in the lunar calendar ) .
The entire length of the qin ( in Chinese measurements ) is 3 feet , 6.5 inches , representing the 365 days of the year ( though this is just a standard since qins can be shorter or longer depending on the period 's measurement standard or the maker 's preference ) .
Each part of the qin has meaning , some more obvious , like " dragon pool " 『 龍池 』 and " phoenix pond " 『 鳳沼 』 .

Figs are pollinated by fig wasps . <SEP> The flowers are pollinated by very small wasps which crawl through the opening in search of a suitable place to lay eggs .
The syconium often has a bulbous shape with a small opening ( the ostiole ) at the outward end used by pollinators .
Without this , fig trees can not reproduce by seed .
There is typically " only one species of wasp that is able to pollinate the flowers of each type of fig " .
For example , in Hawaii , some 60 types of figs have been introduced , but only four of the wasps that pollinate them have been introduced , so only four species of figs produce possible seeds there .
This is an example of a helping relationship , in which each fig plant and fig wasp benefit each other .
Many figs are grown for their fruit , though only the Common Fig , is grown to any amount for eating .
Depending on the type , each fruit can contain up to several hundred to several thousand seeds .
Then the actual flowers of the fig are not seen unless the fig is cut open .
There are more than 850 kinds of " Ficus " , the fig tree .
The common fig ( " Ficus carica " ) is a gynodioecious plant , which means its fruits are either hermaphrodite and " inedible figs " or caprifigs .
In traditional culture in the Mediterranean region they were considered food for goats ( " Capra aegagrus " ) : ' caprifig ' means ' goat fig ' .
Fig wasps grow in caprifigs but not in the female syconiums . <SEP> The female flower is too long for the wasp to successfully lay her eggs in them .
When the wasp dies , it is broken down by enzymes inside the fig .
The wasp does not transmit any diseases harmful to humans .

The Star of Bethlehem , also called the Christmas Star , is a star in the Bible and Christian tradition that let the Magi know that Jesus was born , and later helped them go to Bethlehem . <SEP> According to the Gospel of Matthew , the star made the magi travel to Jerusalem .
There they met King Herod of Judea , and asked where the king of the Jews had been born .
Herod 's advisors said that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem , a nearby village , because of a prophecy in the Book of Micah .
The star stopped above the place where Jesus was born .
The Gospel of Matthew says that Magi ( usually translated as " wise men " , but probably meaning here " astronomer " or " astrologer " ) came to the court of Herod in Jerusalem and told the king of a star which marked the birth of the King of the Jews : Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king , behold ( see ) , wise men from the East came to Jerusalem , saying , " Where is He who has been born King of the Jews ?
When Herod the king heard this , he was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him . <SEP> Herod was " troubled " – not about the star , but because a " king of the Jews " had been born .
So he asked his helpers where the Messiah would be born .
They replied that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem , the place where King David was born , remembering what the prophet Micah had said .
The king told this to the magi .
Matthew suggests that the magi knew from the star that the " king of the Jews " had already been born even before they entered Jerusalem .
They gave Jesus gold , frankincense , and myrrh as presents .
The magi were told in a dream not to go back to Jerusalem . <SEP> So , they " left for their own country by another road " .
When Herod found out that he had been tricked , he ordered all male children in Bethlehem who were 2 or younger to be killed .
Joseph was warned in a dream to escape . <SEP> He took his family to Egypt to be safe .
The Gospel connects the escape to a verse from the Old Testament , which is seen as a prophecy : " Out of Egypt I called My Son . "
Because of this , the quote seems to suggest that Matthew thought that Jesus ' life was like the story of the Jewish people .
After Herod died , God called Joseph and his family back from Egypt , and they settled in to Nazareth in Galilee .
Matthew wrote that Jesus was born when Herod was king .
According to Josephus , Herod died shortly after a lunar eclipse .
This lunar eclipse is often thought of as the eclipse of March 13 , 4 BC .

Allosaurus was a large theropod dinosaur from the Jurassic period , a predatory carnivore .
" Allosaurus " averaged 8.5 metres ( 28 ft ) in length , though some remains suggest it could reach over 12 meters ( 39 ft ) .
Its three-fingered forelimbs were smaller than its large hind legs , and the body was balanced by a long , heavy tail .
" Allosaurus " was at the top of the food chain . <SEP> It probably preyed on large herbivorous dinosaurs and perhaps even other predators ( e.g. " Ceratosaurus " ) .
Potential prey included ornithopods , stegosaurs , and sauropods .
Another study showed the skull was very strong but had a relatively small bite force .
The authors suggested that " Allosaurus " used its skull like a hatchet against prey , attacking open-mouthed , slashing flesh with its teeth , and tearing it away without splintering bones .
They suggested that different strategies could be used against different prey . <SEP> The skull was light enough to allow attacks on smaller and more agile ornithopods , but strong enough for high-impact ambush attacks against larger prey like stegosaurs and sauropods .
Their ideas were challenged by other researchers , who found no modern examples of a hatchet attack . <SEP> They thought it more likely that the skull was strong to absorb stresses from struggling prey .
The original authors noted that " Allosaurus " itself has no modern equivalent , so the absence of a modern ' hatchet attacker ' was not significant . <SEP> They thought the tooth row was well-suited to such an attack , and that articulations ( joints ) in the skull helped to lessen stress .
Another possibility for handling large prey is that theropods like " Allosaurus " were ' flesh grazers ' which could take bites of flesh out of living sauropods , sufficient to sustain the predator so it did not need to kill the prey outright .
This strategy might have allowed the prey to recover and be fed upon again later .
Another idea is that ornithopods , the most common available prey , could be subdued by " Allosaurus " grasping the prey with their forelimbs , and then making bites on the throat to crush the trachea .
The forelimbs were strong and capable of restraining prey , and the articulation of the claws suggests that they could have been used to hook things .
The shape of the " Allosaurus " skull limited binocular vision to 20 ° of width , slightly less than that of modern crocodilians .
As with crocodiles , this may have been enough to judge prey distance and time attacks .
" Allosaurus " is top predator in both Arthur Conan Doyle 's 1912 novel , " The Lost World " , and its 1925 film adaptation , the first full-length motion picture to feature dinosaurs .
" Allosaurus " was used as the starring dinosaur of the 1956 film " The Beast of Hollow Mountain " , and the 1969 film " The Valley of Gwangi " .
Gwangi is billed as an " Allosaurus " , though Ray Harryhausen based his model for the creature on Charles R. Knight 's depiction of a " Tyrannosaurus " .
" Allosaurus " appeared in the second episode of the 1999 BBC television series " Walking with Dinosaurs " and the follow-up special " The Ballad of Big Al " , which speculated on the life of the ' Big Al ' specimen , as revealed by the numerous injuries and pathologies in its skeleton .

Christianity started out as a Jewish sect in the eastern Mediterranean .
Following the Age of Discovery , through missionary work and colonization , Christianity spread to Africa , the Americas , and the rest of the world .
The most basic part of Christianity is the belief in Jesus as the Son of God and Messiah ( Christ ) .
The Christian belief of the Messiah is much different than the contemporary Jewish concept .
The main Christian belief is that , through the death and resurrection of Jesus , sinful humans can be reconciled to God . <SEP> Through this , they believe they are given salvation and eternal life .
There have been many theological disagreements over the nature of Jesus over the first centuries of Christian history . <SEP> But Christians generally believe that Jesus is God incarnate and " true God and true man . "

Nontrinitarianism ( also called Oneness ) is the beliefs systems that reject the Trinity .
Many different Nontrinitarian views , such as adoptionism or modalism , existed in early Christianity , leading to the disputes about Christology .
Christianity began in the 1st century AD as a Jewish sect but quickly spread throughout the Greco-Roman world . <SEP> During the Age of Exploration , Christianity expanded throughout the world , and is now the largest religion of the world .
Some believe Christianity is bigger and includes others .

Seeds have been an important development in the reproduction and spread of conifers and flowering plants . <SEP> Plants such as mosses , liverworts and ferns do not have seeds , and use unprotected spores and other methods to propagate themselves .
Before the upper Devonian period , land plants , like modern ferns , reproduced by sending spores into the air . <SEP> The spores would land and become new plants only in favourable conditions .
The evolution of seeds changed the plant life cycle by freeing plants from the need for external water for sexual reproduction , and by providing protection and nutrients for the developing embryo .
This can be seen by the success of seed plants in important biological niches on land , from forests to grasslands both in hot and cold climates .

The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful and specialized jaw .
Compared to other felines , domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth : this is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents .
Cats , like dogs , walk directly on their toes , with the bones of their feet making up the lower part of the visible leg .
Cats walk very precisely .
Unlike most mammals , when cats walk , they use a " pacing " gait ( walking style ) ; that is , they move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side .
As a walk speeds up into a trot , a cat 's gait will change to be a " diagonal " gait , similar to that of most other mammals : the diagonally opposite hind and forelegs will move at the same time .
On the inside of the front paws there is something which looks like a sixth " finger " .
This special feature on the inside of the wrists is the carpal pad . <SEP> The carpal pad is also found on other cats and on dogs .
Others are harmless , like polydactyly .
Most cats have only four to five toes per paw , depending on whether it is the front or back paw .
Cats are active carnivores , meaning that in the wild they hunt live prey .
Cats , especially kittens , practice these instinctive behaviours in play with each other or on small toys . <SEP> Young kittens are playful .
Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last 4 to 6 days .
Several toms may be attracted to a queen in heat .
At first , the female will reject the male , but eventually the female will allow the male to mate .
The female will utter a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her . <SEP> This is because a male cat 's penis has a band of about 120-150 backwards-pointing spines , which are about one millimeter long ; upon withdrawal of the penis , the spines rake the walls of the female 's vagina , which is a trigger for ovulation .
After mating , the female will wash her vulva thoroughly . <SEP> Then she will clean it thoroughly , with her tongue , if necessary .
If a male attempts to breed with her at this point , the female will attack him .
After about 20 to 30 minutes . <SEP> once the female is finished grooming , the cycle will repeat .
Because ovulation is not always triggered , females may not get pregnant by the first tom which mates with them .
A queen may mate with more than one tom when she is in heat , and different kittens in a litter may have different fathers .
The gestation period for cats is about two months , with an average length of 66 days .
Kittens are " weaned " at between six and seven weeks , and cats normally reach sexual maturity at 5 – 10 months ( females ) and to 5 – 7 months ( males ) . <SEP> This is done after they are weaned , when they are ready for some kitten food .

In order to avoid this fate , Gill gives Nemo a role in an escape plan , which involves jamming the tank 's filter and forcing the dentist to remove the fish from the tank to clean it manually . <SEP> The fish would be placed in plastic bags , at which point they would roll out the window and into the harbor .
While leaving the East Australian Current , Marlin and Dory get lost in the blooms of plankton and krill and are caught by a blue whale .
So , the whale carries them to Sydney Harbour and expels them through his blowhole .
They are met by Nigel , who recognizes Marlin from the stories he has heard and rescues him and Dory from a flock of hungry seagulls by scooping them into his beak and taking them to the dentist 's man 's office .
By this time , Darla has arrived and the dentist is prepared to give Nemo to her .
Nemo tries to play dead in hopes of saving himself , and , at the same time , Nigel arrives .
After a struggle , Gill helps Nemo escape into a drain through a sink .
Back at the dentist 's office , the high-tech filter breaks down and The Tank Gang escape into the harbor . <SEP> But , they realize that they are trapped in the bags of water that the dentist put them into when cleaning the tank .
The inspiration for Nemo was made up of multiple experiences . <SEP> The idea goes back to when director Andrew Stanton was a child , when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank , assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home .
There he saw the shark tube and various exhibits he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation .
Later , in 1997 he took his son for a walk in the park , but found that he was over protecting him constantly and lost an opportunity to have any " father-son experiences " on that day .
Also , clownfish are very colourful , but do n't tend to come out of an anemone very often , and for a character who has to go on a dangerous journey , Stanton felt a clownfish was the perfect kind of fish for the character .
Pre-production of the film took place in early 1997 .
As such , it began production with a complete screenplay , something that co-director Lee Unkrich called " very unusual for an animated film . "
The artists took scuba diving lessons so they could go and study the coral reef .
The idea for the initiation sequence came from a story conference between Andrew Stanton and Bob Peterson while driving to record the actors .
Ellen DeGeneres was cast after Stanton was watching " Ellen " with his wife and seeing Ellen " change the subject five times before finishing one sentence " as Stanton recalled .
There was a pelican character known as Gerald ( who in the final film ends up swallowing and choking on Marlin and Dory ) who was originally a friend of Nigel .
They were going to play against each other as Nigel being neat fastidious while Gerald being scruffy and sloppy .
However the filmmakers could not find an appropriate scene for them that did n't slow the pace of the picture down , so Gerald 's character was minimized .

Diarrhea ( DIE-uh-REE-uh ) , also spelled diarrhoea , happens when the body makes more watery feces than normal .
In developing countries , diarrhea is also one of the most common causes of malnutrition in children under age 5 .
If the child can not go to a clinic or hospital , oral rehydration solution can be used .
Medical illnesses , and treatment with certain medicines , can cause symptoms very similar to that of schizophrenia .
For this reason , it is important to rule out the possibility of either of these things being the cause for the person 's symptoms .
The DSM-IV-TR or the ICD-10 criteria are used to determine whether a person has schizophrenia .
These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities ( unusual occurrences ) in the behavior of the person , followed by a clinical assessment .
Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , a disorder in which a person becomes obsessed with certain ideas or actions . <SEP> However , separating the obsessions of OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia can be difficult .
Schizophrenia is a mental illness .
Some common signs are strange beliefs , unclear or confused thinking and language , hallucinations ( such as hearing voices that are n't there ) , poor interaction with others , less expression of feelings , and not doing much .
People with schizophrenia often have delusions or hallucinations . <SEP> People with schizophrenia may also have other mental health disorders , like depression , anxiety and drug abuse .
There are many risk factors that may cause a person to develop schizophrenia .
The symptoms of schizophrenia fall into three main categories : positive symptoms , negative symptoms , and cognitive symptoms .
Positive symptoms are thoughts , behaviors , or anything experienced by the senses that are not shared by others - like hearing voices that are not really there .
These symptoms may include having strange thoughts that do not make sense ( delusions ) , disorganized thoughts and speech , and feeling , hearing , seeing , smelling , or tasting things that do not exist ( hallucinations ) .
Positive symptoms often respond to drug treatment and cognitive behavioral therapy , CBT .
There are may environmental risk factors factors for schizophrenia such as drug use , stress before birth and in some cases exposure to infectious diseases ( a disease that spreads from person to person ) .
In addition , living in a city during childhood or as an adult has been found to double the risk of schizophrenia . <SEP> This is true even after taking into account drug use , race , and the size of one ’ s social group .
Other factors that play an important role include whether the person feels socially isolated , as well as social adversity , racial discrimination ( treating a person badly because of their race ) , the person 's family not working properly , unemployment , and poor housing conditions .
There is evidence that childhood experiences of abuse or trauma are risk factors for developing schizophrenia later in life . <SEP> There is no clear evidence that treating schizophrenia with anti-psychotic drugs early is effective .
The British NICE guidelines recommend cognitive behavioural talk therapy for all people at risk .
There is some evidence which shows that early treatment with drugs improves short term outcomes for people who have a serious episode of mental illness . <SEP> These measures show little benefit five years later .
Attempting to prevent schizophrenia in the pre-onset phase with anti-psychotic drugs is of uncertain benefit and so is not recommended ( as of 2009 ) .
Prevention is difficult because there is no reliable way to find out in advance who will get schizophrenia .
Numerous mental and social interventions can be useful in treating schizophrenia . <SEP> Such interventions include various types of therapy , community-based treatments , supported employment , skills training , token economic interventions , and mental interventions for drug or alcohol use and weight management .
Family therapy or education , which addresses the whole family system of an individual , might reduce a return of symptoms or the need for hospitalizations ( having to go into hospital . )
There is growing evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy ( also known as “ talk therapy ” ) .
Illegal drugs such as LSD , amphetamines , magic mushrooms and cocaine may cause schizophrenia symptoms .
About half of those people who have schizophrenia use too much drugs or alcohol , possibly to deal with depression , anxiety , boredom , or loneliness .
Frequent marijuana use may double the risk of serious mental illness , including schizophrenia .
It is believed that there are problems with the brain 's wiring in schizophrenia .
For this reason , some scientists think that schizophrenia is several separate illnesses that have some of the same symptoms .
More people with schizophrenia smoke than the general population ; it is estimated that at least 60 % to as many as 90 % of people with schizophrenia smoke . <SEP> Use of cigarettes is especially high in individuals who have schizophrenia , with estimates ranging from 80 to 90 percent of these people being regular smokers , compared to 20 percent of the general population .
Recent research suggests that cigarette smoking may be a risk factor for developing schizophrenia .
Antipsychotic medications substantially reduce the risk of relapse in the stable phase of illness and are strongly recommended .
For people who are unwilling or unable to take drugs regularly , injectable long-acting preparations of antipsychotics can be used .
When used in combination with mental and social interventions ( treatment ) , such preparations can help people to continue their treatment .
The condition results in a decreased life expectancy of 12 to 15 years , primarily because of its association with being overweight , not exercising , and smoking cigarettes .
An increased rate of suicide ( a person killing themself ) plays a lesser role .
Schizophrenia is a major cause of disability , with active psychosis ranked as the third-most-disabling condition .
Approximately three-fourths of people with schizophrenia have an ongoing disability with symptoms that keep coming back .
In people with a first episode of serious mental symptoms , 42 percent have a good long-term outcome , 35 percent have an intermediate outcome and 27 percent have a poor outcome .
Outcomes for schizophrenia appear better in the developing world than in the developed world , although that conclusion has been questioned .
The suicide rate of people who have schizophrenia is estimated to be about 4.9 percent , most often occurring in the period following the first appearance of symptoms or the first hospital admission .
20 to 40 percent try to kill themselves at least once .
Those individuals who smoke tend to smoke heavily and to smoke cigarettes with a high nicotine content .
As of 2011 , schizophrenia affects around 0.3 % to 0.7 % of people , or 24 million people worldwide , at some point in their lives .
Schizophrenia usually appears earlier in men .
Symptoms that start in childhood , middle or old age are much rarer .
Despite the received wisdom that schizophrenia occurs at similar rates worldwide , its rate of likelihood varies across the world , within countries , and at the local level .
The disorder causes approximately 1 % of worldwide disability adjusted life years ( in other words , years spent with a disability ) .
The rate of schizophrenia varies depending on how it is defined .
Taupe refers to a dark grayish-brown color .

The Constitution of Australia are the laws that set up the Australian Commonwealth Government and the way it works .
It is made up of several documents .
The most important is the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia .
The people of Australia voted in referendums from 1898 – 1900 to accept the Constitution . <SEP> Even if the United Kingdom Parliament were to remove the " Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 " , it would have no effect on Australia .
Even though the Constitution was an Act of the United Kingdom parliament , the Australia Acts took away the power of the United Kingdom parliament to change the Constitution . <SEP> Now only the Australian people can change it by referendum .
Two other laws support the Australian Constitution .
The first is the Statute of Westminster , as passed by the Commonwealth as the " Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 . " <SEP> The second is the " Australia Act 1986 " , which was passed by the Parliaments of every Australian state , the United Kingdom , and the Australian Federal Parliament .
Together , these Acts had the effect of cutting all constitutional links between Australia and the United Kingdom .
Even though the same person , Queen Elizabeth II , is the monarch of both countries , these are now separate countries .
The history of the Constitution of Australia began with moves towards federation in the 19th century . <SEP> This led to the Australian colonies joining together to form the Commonwealth of Australian 1901 .
The British Parliament passed the " Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act " in 1900 .
Western Australia finally agreed to join the Commonwealth in time for it to join the Commonwealth of Australia , which officially began on 1 January 1901 .
Although Federation made Australia independent of Britain , legally the Commonwealth was a creation of the British Imperial Parliament , through the " Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act " 1900 ( Imp ) , which applied to Australia .
As a result , there was continued uncertainty as to whether British Imperial laws still applied to the Commonwealth .
This was fixed by the " Statute of Westminster 1931 " , adopted by the Commonwealth via the " Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 " .
The Statute of Westminster freed the Dominions , including the Commonwealth , from Imperial laws and controls .
Legally , this is the moment of Australia 's national independence .
However , British laws were still more important in Australian states .
This was fixed by the " Australia Act 1986 " , which was passed by the parliaments of Australia , the United Kingdom , and each of the states .
This law stopped the British Parliament 's power to make laws over Australian states . <SEP> It also stopped appeals from the Australian courts to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council .
As this was a very important document , Queen Elizabeth II travelled to Australia to sign the proclamation of the law .
One result of these two laws is that Australia is now a fully independent country . <SEP> The Constitution is now different from the original Act , as the Australian people can change the Constitution , by referendum .
Under Australia 's common law system , the High Court of Australia and the Federal Court of Australia have the power to decide what the constitution actually means .
Chapter I sets up the Parliament of Australia .
Section 1 says that legislative power belongs to the Parliament .
Executive power is to be exercised by the Governor-General , advised by the Federal Executive Council .
The Governor-General is the commander in chief . <SEP> He or she may appoint and dismiss the members of the Executive Council , ministers of state , and all officers of the executive government .
These powers , along with the powers to dissolve ( or refuse to dissolve ) parliament ( Section 5 , Section 57 ) , are termed " reserve powers " . <SEP> The use of these powers is by convention .
There has been only one instance of the Governor-General not taking the Prime Minister 's advice .
Governor-General Sir John Kerr , acting on his own , dismissed Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis .
Chapter III sets up the judicial branch of government .
Section 71 gives judicial power in a " Federal Supreme Court " to be called the High Court of Australia .
Such courts are called " Chapter III Courts " are the only courts that can use federal judicial power .
Sections 73 and 75-78 outline the original and appellate jurisdiction of the High Court .
Section 74 explains how an appeal can be made to the Queen in Council .
Section 79 allows Parliament to limit the number of judges able to exercise federal jurisdiction and section 80 guarantees trial by jury for indictable offences against the Commonwealth .
Chapter VIII sets out how the Constitution can be changed .
Section 128 says that changes must be approved by a referendum .
Part II of Chapter 1 is about the Senate .
Each State is to have the same number of senators .
Part III of Chapter 1 is about the House of Representatives .
Section 24 says the House must have twice as many members as the Senate , each elected by a single electorate .
This is called the ' Nexus ' . <SEP> It designed to prevent swamping of the senate 's power in the case of a joint sitting ( see Section 57 below ) .
The number of electorates in a State is to be based on its share of the national population .
Part V of Chapter 1 is about the powers of the parliament .
There are " concurrent powers " , as both the Commonwealth and States can make laws on these subjects .
Federal law is more important if the laws are different ( Section 109 ) . <SEP> Section 109 says that , where a State law is different to a federal law , the federal law is the legal law .
Of the thirty-nine parts of section 51 , a few have become very important in deciding how much power the Commonwealth government has in law . <SEP> These include the Trade and Commerce Power , the Corporations Power and the External Affairs Power .
Section 52 deals with powers that belong only to the Commonwealth parliament .
States can not make laws on these subjects .
Section 81 says that all Commonwealth revenue shall form the Consolidated Revenue Fund .
Parliament can make laws as to the how its money is spent ( Section 53 ) .
Unlike most other powers of the parliament , laws made under this power can not usually be challenged .
Chapter V sets out how what the States can do in a federal system .
Sections 106-108 preserves the Constitution , powers of the Parliament , and the laws in force of each of the States .

Some non-Muslim scholars have written works which are read by many Muslims .
Before 1980 , such non-Muslim scholars in this field had been called " Islamicists " .
Many universities have degrees on the subject of Islamic studies .

During her lifetime , Austen 's books did not make her very famous .
Like a great number of women writers at that time , she chose to publish her books secretly .
At the time they were published , Austen 's works were thought fashionable by members of high society . <SEP> However , they received only a few good reviews .
By the mid-nineteenth century , her works were respected by people who were learned in literature .
However , novel-writing was not easy for women in the early nineteenth century .
So like a great number of other female writers , Austen published her books secretly .
In time , though , her writing became an open secret among the aristocracy .
Austen refused the librarian 's suggestion after that to write a historical romance for the prince 's daughter 's marriage .
But it was not until the 1940s that Austen was widely accepted as a " great English novelist " .
In the second half of the twentieth century , people began studying Austen more and more , and in different ways . <SEP> For example , they studied her works artistically , ideologically , and historically .
The university English departments began developing in the first half of the twentieth century .
As they grew , criticism of Austen split into remarkable high culture and popular culture trends .
In the late twentieth century , fans made Jane Austen societies and clubs . <SEP> They praised Austen , her time , and her works .
In the early twenty-first century , Austen fans support an industry of printed sequels and prequels . <SEP> They also support Austen 's work in television and film .
For years , people thought the same of Austen as Scott and Whately . <SEP> Only a few people actually read her novels .
In 1870 the first important Austen biography , " A Memoir of Jane Austen " , was written by Jane Austen 's nephew , James Edward Austen-Leigh and printed .
When it came out in print , Austen 's popularity and critical standing increased greatly .
The " Memoir " made Austen 's books be printed again in great numbers .
The first popular editions came out in 1883 . <SEP> They were a cheap series printed by Routledge .
This was followed by editions with pictures , collectors ' sets , and scholarly editions .
However , after the " Memoir " was printed , much more criticism about Austen was printed . <SEP> More came out in two years than had come out in the last 50 years .
After the Second World War , people began studying Austen more deeply , and in different ways .
A great number of people have studied Austen as a political writer .
Critic Gary Kelly explains , " Some see her as a political ' conservative ' because she seems to defend the established social order .
Others see her as sympathetic to ' radical ' politics that challenged the established order , especially in the form of patriarchy ... some critics see Austen 's novels as ... complex , criticizing aspects of the social order but supporting stability and an open class hierarchy . "
In " Jane Austen and the War of Ideas " ( 1975 ) , perhaps the most important of these works , Marilyn Butler argues that Austen was greatly influenced by the principal moral and political arguments of her time , and that she had a partisan , firmly conservative and Christian position in these arguments .
As Rajeswari Rajan notes , " the idea of a political Austen is no longer seriously challenged " .
The questions scholars now study include : " the Revolution , war , nationalism , empire , class , ' improvement ' of the estate , the clergy , town versus ( against ) country , abolition , the professions , female emancipation ; whether her politics were Tory , Whig , or radical ; whether she was a conservative or a revolutionary , or occupied ( kept ) a reformist position between these extremes " .
Austen 's books quickly became fashionable . <SEP> Aristocrats who liked to set the fashion and taste of the day especially liked them .
Henrietta Ponsonby , Countess of Bessborough wrote about " Sense and Sensibility " in a letter to a friend . <SEP> She said : " it is a clever novel .
The 15-year-old daughter of the Prince Regent , Princess Charlotte Augusta , compared herself to Marianne Dashwood . <SEP> She remarked , " I think Marianne & me are very like in " disposition " , that certainly I am not so good , the same imprudence , & tc " .
He told a friend to " buy it immediately " for it " was one of the cleverest things " he had ever read .
Anne Milbanke , future wife of Lord Byron , wrote that " I have finished the Novel called Pride and Prejudice , which I think a very superior ( good ) work . "
She added that " is the most " probable " fiction I have ever read " and had become " at present the fashionable novel " .
The Dowager Lady Vernon told a friend that " Mansfield Park " was " not much of a novel , more the history of a family party in the country , very natural " .
Lady Anne Romilly told her friend , the writer Maria Edgeworth , that " " Mansfield Park " has been pretty generally admired here " . <SEP> Edgeworth later said that " we have been much entertained with Mansfield Park " .
Most of the reviews were short , careful , and approving .
They mostly focused on the moral lessons of her books .
Brian Southam writes about these reviewers : " their job was merely to provide brief ( short ) notices , extended with quotations , for the benefit ( good ) of women readers compiling their library lists and interested only in knowing whether they would like a book for its story , its characters and moral " .
" Northanger Abbey " and " Persuasion " were published together in December 1817 . <SEP> They were reviewed in the " British Critic " in March 1818 and in the " Edinburgh Review and Literary Miscellany " in May 1818 .
The reviewer for the " British Critic " felt that Austen 's great use of realism was proof of a limited imagination .
Austen scholars have pointed out that these early reviewers did not know what to make of her works . <SEP> For example , they wrongly understood her use of irony .
Reviewers thought " Sense and Sensibility " and " Pride and Prejudice " were stories of virtue overcoming vice .
They were not always easy to get in Europe .
Austen was not well known in Russia . <SEP> The first Russian translation of an Austen novel did not appear until 1967 .
Austen ’ s works were translated into various European languages . <SEP> However , Europeans did not see her works as part of the English novel tradition .
This was partly because of the changes made by translators . <SEP> They put in sentimentalism into Austen 's works .
Therefore , European readers more often thought of Walter Scott 's style as the English novel .
The great changes made by her translators made the Continent receive Austen differently than in Britain .
In Montolieu 's " Pride and Prejudice " , lively conversations ( talks ) between Elizabeth and Darcy were replaced by calm , proper ones .
Cossy and Saglia explained , " the equality of mind which Elizabeth takes for granted is denied ( not given ) and gender distinction introduced " .
Austen ’ s works were seen in France as part of a sentimental tradition . <SEP> Because of this , people were more interested in the works of French realists like Stendhal , Balzac , and Flaubert .
After Bradley and Chapman , Austen scholarship grew very quickly in the 1920s . <SEP> British writer E. M. Forster pointed out Austen 's works for his idea of the " round " character .
Lascelles included a short essay about her , a study of the books Austen read and their influence on her writing , and a study of Austen 's style and " narrative art " .
Lascelles felt that critics before her had all worked in a way " so small that the reader does not see how they have reached their conclusions until he has patiently found his own way to them " .
She wished to study all of Austen 's works , style , and techniques together .
Critics after Lascelles agreed that she studied them well .
Lascelles was interested in Austen 's connection to Samuel Johnson and her desire to discuss morality through fiction .
But around this time , some fans of Austen began to worry that her works were being enjoyed by only a few people .
Mid-century revisionist views started to become popular , and scholars began studying Austen more sceptically .
D. W. Harding , adding to Farrer , wrote an essay called " Regulated Hatred : An Aspect of the Work of Jane Austen " .
He argued that Austen did not support society 's customs , and that her irony was not funny but bitter .
Through her use of irony , Austen tried to protect herself as an artist and a person from the behavior and practices she disliked .
Almost at the same time , British critic Q. D. Leavis printed " Critical Theory of Jane Austen 's Writing " in " Scrutiny " in the early 1940s . <SEP> In there , Leavis argued that Austen was a professional , not an amateur ( untrained ) , writer .
Harding 's and Leavis 's articles were followed by " Jane Austen : Irony as Defense and Discovery " ( 1952 ) .
This was written by Martin Mudrick , who saw Austen as lonely , defensive , and critical of her society . <SEP> He carefully described the connection between Austen 's attitude towards the literature of her time and how she used irony to show the difference of how society was , and how she thought it could be .
They agreed that she " combined ( put together ) Henry Fielding 's and Samuel Richardson 's qualities of interiority and irony , realism and satire to form an author superior to ( better than ) both " .
American novelist Henry James liked Austen . <SEP> Once he said she was as great as Shakespeare , Cervantes , and Henry Fielding - " the fine painters of life " .
But James thought Austen was an " unconscious " artist who was " instinctive and charming " .
In 1905 , James said he did not like the public interest in Austen . <SEP> He said it was more than Austen 's " intrinsic merit ( worth ) and interest " deserved .
James said that this was mostly because of the " stiff breeze of the commercial , ... the special bookselling spirits .
... the body of publishers , editors , illustrators , producers of the pleasant twaddle of magazines ; who have found their ' dear , ' our dear , everybody 's dear , Jane ... to their material purpose , ... to pretty reproduction in every variety of what is called tasteful , and in what seemingly proves to be salable , form . "
Reginald Farrer , a British travel writer , did not like the sentimental image of " Aunt Jane " . <SEP> Jane Austen scholar A. Walton Litz called it the best single introduction to her works .
Southam calls it as a " Janeite " piece without the worship .
Farrer was one of the first critics who saw Austen as a subversive writer .

Yamamoto 's main goal was to destroy America 's carrier forces , which he saw as the main threat to the Pacific campaign .
This concern was increased by the Doolittle Raid on 18 April 1942 . <SEP> In this raid , 16 US Army Air Forces B-25 Mitchell bombers launched from bombed targets in Tokyo and several other Japanese cities .
The raid , while militarily unimportant , showed that American bombers could reach Japanese territory .
This and other successful raids by American carriers showed that they were still a threat .
Yamamoto thought that another attack on the U.S Naval base at Pearl Harbor would make all of the American fleet to sail out to fight , including the carriers .
However , because of the many American land-based airplanes on Hawaii , he thought that it was too risky to attack directly .
Instead , he decided to attack Midway , a tiny atoll at the northwest end of the Hawaiian Island chain , approximately 1300 mi from Oahu .
The Japanese did n't need Midway but they felt the Americans would try hard to defend it .
Midway 's airstrips were also used for bomber attacks on Wake Island .
During the Battle of the Coral Sea one month earlier , the Japanese light carrier " Sho ̄ ho ̄ " had been sunk and the fleet carrier had three bomb hits , and was in drydock undergoing repairs .
Although the carrier was undamaged , she had lost almost half her airplanes and was in port in Kure awaiting new planes and pilots .
No new pilots were available because none had been trained .
Flight instructors were used in an effort to make up the missing aircrew .
The main Japanese carrier-based aircraft were the Aichi D3A1 dive bomber and the Nakajima B5N2 , which was used either as a torpedo bomber or as a bomber .
However , production of the D3A had been reduced , while production of the B5N had been stopped . <SEP> None were available to replace losses .
In addition many of the aircraft being used during the June 1942 operations had been operating since late November 1941 ; many were almost worn out and had become increasingly unreliable .
These factors meant that all carriers of the " Kido Butai " had fewer aircraft than normal and there were not enough spare aircraft or parts .
I Japan 's main carrier fighter was the fast Mitsubishi A6M2 " Zero " .
At about 09:00 on 3 June , a US Navy patrol plane spotted the Japanese Occupation Force 500 nmi to the west-southwest of Midway .
Three hours later , the Americans found the Japanese transport group 570 nmi to the west .
Early the following morning the Japanese oil tanker " Akebono Maru " was hit by a torpedo from an attacking PBY .
At 04:30 on 4 June , Nagumo launched his attack on Midway . <SEP> It consisted of 36 dive bombers 36 torpedo bombers , escorted by 36 Mitsubishi Zero fighters .
His eight search planes launched 30 minutes late .
Japanese reconnaissance plans were poor , with too few aircraft to cover the search areas .
As Nagumo 's bombers and fighters were taking off , 11 PBYs were leaving Midway to search for Japanese ships .
They reported sighting two Japanese carriers with empty decks , which meant an air strike was on its way .
American radar picked up the enemy at a distance of several miles , and planes were sent off to defend Midway .
Bombers headed off to attack the Japanese carrier fleet . <SEP> US fighters remained behind to defend Midway .
Midway-based Marine fighter pilots , flying F4Fs and obsolescent F2As , intercepted the Japanese and had many losses .
Most of the U.S. planes were shot down in the first few minutes ; several were damaged , and only two could fly . <SEP> In all , 3 F4Fs and 13 F2As were shot down .
American anti-aircraft fire was accurate damaging many Japanese aircraft and destroying four .
American bombers based on Midway made several attacks on the Japanese carrier fleet .
These included six Grumman Avengers from the 's VT-8 ( Midway was the first combat mission for the VT-8 airmen , and it was the first combat of the TBF ) , Marine Scout-Bombing Squadron 241 ( VMSB-241 ) , consisting of eleven SB2U-3s and sixteen SBDs , plus four USAAF B-26s , armed with torpedoes , and fifteen B-17s .
The Japanese fought off these attacks . <SEP> The US lost two fighters , five TBFs , two SB2Us , eight SBDs and two B-26s .
Admiral Nagumo had kept half of his aircraft in reserve .
These were two squadrons of dive bombers and torpedo bombers .
At 07:15 Nagumo ordered his reserve planes to be re-armed with bombs for use against land targets .
At 07:40 a scout plane from " Tone " saw a big American naval force to the east .
It seems that Nagumo did not receive the report until 08:00 .
Nagumo reversed his order , but it took 40 minutes before " Tone "'s scout finally radioed that there was a carrier in the American force .
This was one of the carriers from TF 16 ; the other carrier was not sighted . <SEP> Neither of the carriers of Spruance 's Task Force 16 was damaged .
" Hiryu ̄ " , the sole surviving Japanese aircraft carrier attacked .
" Hiryu ̄ " 's first attack consisted of 18 dive bombers and six fighter escorts . <SEP> They followed the retreating American aircraft and attacked the " Yorktown " , hitting her with three bombs , which blew a hole in the deck , put out her boilers , and destroyed several anti-aircraft guns .
Despite the damage , repair teams were able to fix the flight deck and fix several boilers in an hour .
Twelve Japanese dive bombers and four escorting fighters were lost in this attack .
In the attack , " Yorktown " was struck by two torpedoes ; she lost all power and developed a tilt to port , which put her out of action .
Admiral Fletcher moved his command staff to the heavy cruiser .
Nagumo was now unsure of what to do .
Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi recommended that Nagumo strike with the forces at hand : 18 Aichi D3A dive bombers each on " So ̄ ryu ̄ " and " Hiryu ̄ " , and half the cover patrol aircraft .
Nagumo 's opportunity to hit the American ships , however , was now limited .
The Midway strike force would be returning shortly and needed to land or crash into the sea .
Because of the constant flight deck activity , the Japanese did not get their reserve planes on the flight deck for launch .
The few aircraft that were ready were defensive Fighter aircraft .
Launching aircraft would have required at least 30 to 45 minutes .
By launching right away , Nagumo would be using some of his reserve without proper anti-ship weapons . <SEP> He had just seen how easily unescorted American bombers had been shot down .
Japanese carrier rules preferred full strikes , and since Nagumo did not know the American force included a carrier , his response followed Japanese rules .
In addition , the arrival of another American air strike at 07:53 made Nagumo want to attack the island again .
Nagumo decided to wait for his first strike force to land , then launch the reserve , which would by then be armed and ready .
Fletcher 's carriers had launched their planes beginning at 07:00 , so the aircraft that attacked Nagumo were already on their way .
Three squadrons of SBDs from " Enterprise " and " Yorktown " ( VB-6 , VS-6 and VB-3 , respectively ) were approaching from the southwest and northeast .
The two squadrons from " Enterprise " were running low on fuel because of the time spent looking for the enemy .
However , the squadron commander decided to continue the search . <SEP> It was moving to rejoin Nagumo 's carriers after having unsuccessfully depth-charged U.S. submarine .
Some bombers were lost from lack of fuel before the attack started .
Late in the afternoon , a " Yorktown " scout aircraft located " Hiryu ̄ " . <SEP> " Enterprise " launched a strike of dive bombers ( including 10 SBDs from " Yorktown " ) .
Despite " Hiryu ̄ " being defended by more than a dozen Zero fighters , the attack by " Enterprise " was successful : four , possibly five bombs hit " Hiryu ̄ " , leaving her on fire and unable to operate aircraft .
( " Hornet "'s strike aimed at the escort ships but it did not get any hits . )
After hopeless attempts to control the fire , most of the crew remaining on " Hiryu ̄ " were taken off the ship . <SEP> The rest of the fleet continued sailing northeast to catch the American carriers .
" Hiryu ̄ " stayed afloat for several more hours .
She was discovered by an aircraft from the light carrier " Ho ̄ sho ̄ " . <SEP> This led to hopes she could be saved or towed back to Japan .
However , soon after being spotted , " Hiryu ̄ " sank .
Rear Admiral Yamaguchi chose to go down with his ship , costing Japan her best carrier officer .
As darkness fell , both sides thought about the situation and made plans for action .
Spruance knew the United States had won a great victory , but he was still unsure of what Japanese forces remained . <SEP> He wanted to protect Midway and his carriers .
He followed Nagumo during the day and continued to follow as night fell .
Finally , fearing a possible night battle with Japanese ships and believing Yamamoto still intended to invade , Spruance pulled back to the east . <SEP> He turned back west towards the enemy at midnight .
Yamamoto decided to continue the attacks and sent his remaining ships searching eastward for the American carriers .
He also sent a cruiser raiding force to bomb the island .
The Japanese ships failed to make contact with the Americans due to Spruance 's decision to pull back eastward , and Yamamoto ordered a withdrawal to the west .
One B-26 , after being seriously damaged by anti-aircraft fire , dove straight toward the " Akagi " .
The plane just missed the carrier 's bridge , which could have killed Nagumo and his command staff .
This may have made Nagumo decide to launch another attack on Midway , against Yamamoto 's order to keep the reserve force for anti-ship operations .
Within six minutes , " So ̄ ryu ̄ " and " Kaga " were on fire .
" Akagi " was also seriously damaged .
The Japanese hoped that " Akagi " could be saved or towed back to Japan . <SEP> Eventually , all three carriers were eventually abandoned and sunk .
Over the following two days , first Midway and then Spruance 's carriers launched several attacks .
" Mikuma " was sunk by Dauntlesses , while " Mogami " survived damage and returned home for repairs .
The destroyers " Arashio " and " Asashio " were also bombed and machine-gunned during the last of these attacks .
The Battle of Midway has been called " the turning point of the Pacific " .
However , even after Midway , the Japanese continued to try to get more territory in the South Pacific . <SEP> The U.S. did not become the more powerful navy until after several more months of hard combat .
Midway was the Allies ' first major victory against the Japanese .
Finally , Midway bought the United States time until the first of the new Essex-class fleet carriers became available at the end of 1942 .
Some authors have stated heavy losses in carriers and veteran aircrews at Midway permanently weakened the Imperial Japanese Navy .
Parshall and Tully , however , have stated that the losses in veteran aircrew , while heavy ( 110 , just under 25 % of the aircrew embarked on the four carriers ) , were not as bad for the Japanese naval air-corps as a whole . <SEP> The Japanese navy had 2,000 carrier-qualified aircrew at the start of the Pacific war .
A few months after Midway , the JNAF sustained similar casualty rates at both the Battle of the Eastern Solomons and Battle of Santa Cruz . <SEP> It was these battles , combined with the constant death of veterans during the Solomons campaign , which weakened Japan .
However , the loss of four large fleet carriers , and over 40 % of the carriers ' aircraft mechanics and technicians , plus the flight-deck crews were very damaging to the Japanese carrier fleet .
After the battle and were the only large carriers of the original Pearl Harbor strike-force left for offensive actions .
Of Japan 's other carriers , was the only Fleet carrier that could be used with " Sho ̄ kaku " and " Zuikaku " , while , , and , were second-rate ships .
By the time of the Battle of the Philippine Sea , while the Japanese had somewhat rebuilt their carrier forces , the planes were flown by inexperienced pilots .
By 1942 the United States was already three years into a shipbuilding plan which aimed make the navy larger than Japan 's .

Usually , sex is determined by an organism 's genes .
With genetic sex determination , most alleles or genes that influence sexual development are on the same chromosome .
That chromosome is then called the sex chromosome .
Because genetic sex determination is controlled by a pair of sex chromosomes ( or by the presence or absence of one of the chromosomes ) , there are usually the same number of male and female offspring .
For some species sex is not determined by inheritance , but instead by environmental factors experienced during development or later in life .
In some turtles , for example , males are produced at lower incubation temperatures than females ; this difference in critical temperatures can be as little as 1-2 ° C.
The trophic state index ( TSI ) is a measure of how much nutrient , such as nitrogen and phosphorus are in a lake , or other body of water .
Nutrients increase plant growth , and raise the trophic levels .
The TSI can be used to make an estimate of the biological condition of a lake .
Carlson 's Index is a Trophic State Index .
It is used by the United States Environmental Protection Agency .
The " trophic state " is the total weight of biomass in a given water body at the time of measurement .
The Carlson index uses the algal biomass to classify a lake 's trophic status .
A lake can be put into one of three possible classes : " oligotrophic " , " mesotrophic " or " eutrophic " .
Lakes with extreme trophic indices can also be called " hyperoligotrophic " or " hypereutrophic " .
Each trophic class has different types of fish and other organisms which live in them .
If there is too much algal biomass in a lake or pond , then many fish can die as the decomposing biomass takes the oxygen from the water .
Oligotrophic lakes have very little or no aquatic vegetation and the water is clear .
They have low levels of nutrients .
The bottom waters of such lakes typically have lots of oxygen ; thus , such lakes often support many fish species . <SEP> Lake trout , for example , need cold , oxygen rich water .
The oxygen content is likely to be higher in deep lakes , because of their larger amount of dense cold water .
Eutrophic lakes have large amounts of organisms , including algal blooms .
They have a lot of nutrient and can support a lot of aquatic plants and algae .
When there are a lot of aquatic plants the water tends to be clear .
When there is a lot of algae the water tends to be darker .
The process of photosynthesis in the algae supplies oxygen to the fish and plants which live these waters .
Sometimes an excessive algae bloom will occur .

The Dromaeosaur skeleton suggests they were active , fast-running , and closely related to birds .
Dromaeosaurs have a relatively large skull , serrated teeth , narrow snout , and forward-facing eyes with some degree of binocular vision .
Dromaeosaurs , like most other theropods , had an S-curved neck , and their trunk was relatively short and deep .
Like other maniraptorans , they had long arms , and relatively large hands with three long fingers ending in large claws .
The dromaeosaur hip structure featured a large ' pubic boot ' ( part of the hip ) projecting beneath the base of the tail .
Dromaeosaur feet bore a large , recurved claw on the second toe .
Their tails were slender , and mainly used as a counter-balance .
Like other theropods , dromaeosaurs were bipedal ; that is , they walked on their hind legs .
Whereas other theropods walked with three toes on the ground , fossilized footprint tracks show that most dromaeosaurs held the second toe off the ground , with only the third and fourth toes bearing the weight of the animal .
The enlarged second toe bore an unusually large , curved sickle-shaped claw .
It is thought to have been used in capturing prey and , in the smaller species , climbing trees .
One dromaeosaur species , " Balaur bondoc " , had a first toe which was highly modified in parallel with the second .
" Mahakala " is both the most primitive dromaeosaur ever described and the smallest . <SEP> " Mahakala " , for example , the most primitive dromaeosaur in terms of structure , falls outside any named sub-group .
This evidence , and " Microraptor " and the troodontid " Anchiornis " , suggests the common ancestor of dromaeosaurs , troodontids , and birds – the ' ancestral paravian ' – may have been very small , at around 65 cm in length and 600 to 700 grams of mass .
The ability to fly or glide has been suggested for at least two dromaeosaur genera .
The first , " Rahonavis " was originally classified as avian bird , but found to be a dromaeosaur in later studies . <SEP> It may have been capable of powered flight .
The subfamilies of Dromaeosauridae is not yet settled .
All known dromaeosaur skin impressions come from this group , and all show an extensive covering of feathers and well-developed wings .
Some species may have been capable of active flight .

" The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar " is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe .

In England , the tale was published first as " Mesmerism in Articulo Mortis " and later as " The Last Days of M. Valdemar " .
Valdemar 's eyes at one point leak a " profuse outflowing of a yellowish ichor " , for example . <SEP> The tale 's imagery is summed up in the final lines : " ... his whole frame at once — within the space of a single minute , or even less , shrunk — crumbled — absolutely rotted away beneath my hands .
The disgusting imagery probably inspired later fiction including that of H. P. Lovecraft .
Those final lines make up one of the most powerfully effective moments in Poe 's work , incorporating shock , disgust , and uneasiness into one moment .
This ending shows that attempts to appropriate power over death will have hideous results and , therefore , ultimately will be unsuccessful .

Chloroplasts are small organelles inside the cells of plants and algae . <SEP> Chloroplasts are one of the many different types of organelles in the cell .
In addition to chlorophyll , a chloroplast uses carbon dioxide ( CO ) and water ( HO ) to form sugar and gives off oxygen ( O ) .
Chlorophyll is what gives green plants their green colour .

They were held every four years until the 6th century AD .
The first " modern " Olympics happened in 1896 in Athens , Greece .
The Olympics of Ancient Greece featured mainly athletic but also combat and chariot racing events .
During the Olympic Games all struggles among the participating city-states were postponed until the games were finished .
The origin of these Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend According to legend , it was Heracles who first called the Games " Olympic " and established the custom of holding them every four years .
The most widely accepted date for the beginning of the Ancient Olympics is 776BC ; based on inscriptions of the winners of a footrace held every four years starting then .
The Ancient Games featured running events , a pentathlon ( consisting of a jumping event , discus and javelin throws , a foot race and wrestling ) , boxing , wrestling , and equestrian events .

" Uncle Tom 's Cabin " was the most popular novel of the 19th century , and the second best-selling book of the century ( the first one was the Bible ) . <SEP> " Uncle Tom 's Cabin " has had a very great influence .
It helped abolitionism spread in the 1850s .
Stowe wrote her novel because of the 1850 passage of the second Fugitive Slave Act .
She was also partly inspired to write her novel by the autobiography of Josiah Henson .
Henson was a black man who had run away and helped many black slaves .
Stowe also said that she got lots of ideas for Uncle Tom 's Cabin by talking to runaway slaves when she was living in Cincinnati , Ohio .
In her book " A Key to Uncle Tom 's Cabin " ( 1853 ) , Stowe wrote about the stories that inspired her when she was writing " Uncle Tom 's Cabin " .
However , later research showed that Stowe did not actually read many of the stories inside the book until after her novel was published .
" Uncle Tom 's Cabin " began in a series in an anti-slavery newspaper , " The National Era " .
Because everybody liked the story so much , John P. Jewett of Boston asked Stowe to turn the serial into a book .
Stowe was not sure if people would like to read the story as a book .
John Jewett , sure that the book would be popular , asked Hammatt Billings to engrave six pictures for the book .
In March 20 , 1852 , the finished book came out .
In the first year it was published , 300,000 copies of the book were sold , and it was translated into many important languages .
When it was published , " Uncle Tom 's Cabin " , people who defended slavery were very angry and protested against it . <SEP> Abolitionists praised it very much .
As a best-seller , the novel greatly influenced later protest literature .
As soon as it was published , " Uncle Tom 's Cabin " made people in the American South very angry .
The novel was also greatly criticized by people who supported slavery .
Some critics said that Stowe had never actually went to a Southern plantation and she did not know much about Southern life . <SEP> They said that because of this , she made wrong descriptions about the South .
However , Stowe always said she made the characters of her book by stories she was told by slaves that ran away to Cincinnati , Ohio , where she lived .
It is reported : " She observed firsthand ( herself ) several incidents ( happenings ) which ... inspired her to write the famous anti-slavery novel .
Scenes she observed ( saw ) on the Ohio River , including seeing a husband and wife being sold apart , as well as newspaper and magazine accounts and interviews , contributed material to the ... plot . "
In 1853 , Stowe published " A Key to Uncle Tom 's Cabin " .
In the book , Stowe writes about the important characters in " Uncle Tom 's Cabin " and about people in real life who were like them . <SEP> Through this book , she writes a more " aggressive attack on slavery in the South than the novel itself had " .
Like the novel , " A Key to Uncle Tom 's Cabin " was also a best-seller .
However , many of the works in " A Key to Uncle Tom 's Cabin " was read by Stowe after she published her novel .
Even though there were such criticisms , the novel was still very popular .
Stowe 's son says that when Abraham Lincoln met her in 1862 Lincoln said , " So this is the little lady who started this great war . "
Historians are not sure if Lincoln really said this or not . <SEP> In a letter that Stowe wrote to her husband a few hours after meeting with Lincoln , she does not say anything about this sentence .
After this , many writers have said that this novel helped make the North angry at slavery and at the Fugitive Slave Law .
Union general and politician James Baird Weaver said that the book made him help in the abolitionist movement .
" Uncle Tom 's Cabin " also interested many people in England .
The first London edition came out in May 1852 . <SEP> It sold 200,000 copies .
Some of this interest was because at that time the British people did not like the United States .
A writer said , " The evil passions which ' Uncle Tom ' gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance of slavery , but national jealousy and national vanity .
We have long been smarting ( hurting ) under the conceit of America – we are tired of hearing her boast that she is the freest and the most enlightened country that the world has ever seen .
Our clergy hate her voluntary system – our Tories hate her democrats – our Whigs hate her ... All parties hailed Mrs. Stowe as a revolter from the enemy . "
Charles Francis Adams , the American minister to Britain during the war , said later that , " " Uncle Tom 's Cabin " ; or " Life among the Lowly " , published in 1852 , influenced the world more quickly , powerfully , and dramatically than any other book ever printed . "
The book was read by so many people that Sigmund Freud believed that some of his patients had been influenced by reading about the whipping of slaves in " Uncle Tom 's Cabin " .

Some later books that were greatly influenced by " Uncle Tom 's Cabin " are " The Jungle " by Upton Sinclair and " Silent Spring " by Rachel Carson .
However , even though " Uncle Tom 's Cabin " was very important , many people thought the book was a mix of " children 's fable and propaganda " .
Many critics called the book " merely ( only ) a sentimental novel " . <SEP> George Whicher wrote in his " Literary History of the United States " that " Nothing attributable to Mrs. Stowe or her handiwork can account for the novel 's enormous ( great ) vogue ( popularity ) ; its author 's resources ... of Sunday-school fiction were not remarkable ... melodrama , humor , and pathos ... compounded ( made up ) her book . "
Edmund Wilson said that " To expose oneself in maturity ( when one has grown up ) to Uncle Tom 's Cabin may ... prove a startling ( surprising ) experience . "
Jane Tompkins said that the novel is one of the classics of American literature . <SEP> She suggested that literary critics think badly of the book because it was simply too popular when it came out .
Through the years , people have wondered what Stowe was trying to say with the novel .
For example , Stowe was a Christian and active abolitionist , and put lots of her religious beliefs in her book .
Some have said that Stowe wrote in her novel what she thought was a solution to the problem that worried many people who did not like slavery .
Was it right to use violence to stop the violence of slavery ? <SEP> Was breaking laws that helped slavery right ?
Which of Stowe 's characters should be followed : the patient Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris ?
Stowe thought that God 's will would be followed if each ( every ) person sincerely ( truly ) examined his principles and acted on ( followed ) them .
People have also thought " Uncle Tom 's Cabin " expressed the ideas of the Free Will Movement .
In this idea , the character of George Harris symbolizes the free labor . <SEP> The complex character of Ophelia shows the Northerners who allowed slavery , even though they did not like it .

She enters the story when Tom saves her from drowning when he was going to be sold .
Eva asks her father to buy Tom .
She talks very much about love and forgiveness .
During Eliza 's escape , she meets her husband , George Harris , who had run away before her .
They decide to try to run away to Canada .
However , they are hunted by a slave hunter named Tom Loker .
Tom Loker finally traps Eliza and her family , so that George shoots Loker .
Eliza is worried that Loker might die and go to hell .

His wife sells Tom to a plantation owner named Simon Legree .
Legree takes Tom to Louisiana . <SEP> There , he meets other slaves , including Emmeline ( who Legree bought at the same time that he bought Tom ) .
Legree begins to hate Tom when Tom disobeys his order to whip the other slaves .
Legree beats him , and decides to destroy Tom 's faith in God .
However , Tom secretly continues to read the Bible and help the other slaves .
At the plantation , Tom meets Cassy , another black slave .
Her two children had been sold , and she had killed her third child because she was afraid that her child would be sold , too .
George , Eliza , and Harry have finally reached Canada and become free .
Meanwhile , Uncle Tom feels so unhappy that he almost gives up , but he has two visions of Jesus and Eva .
When Tom does not tell Legree where they are , Legree tells his men to beat him to death .
Tom forgives the two men who beat him as he dies , and they feel sorry and become Christians .
George Shelby comes just as Tom is dying to free him .
He helps slaves escape , such as Eliza , Emmeline and Cassy .
This theme can be seen when Tom urges St. Clare to " look away to Jesus " after St. Clare 's daughter Eva dies .
After Tom dies , George Shelby says , " What a thing it is to be a Christian . "
Because Christian themes are so important , and because Stowe often directly spoke in the novel about religion and faith , the novel is written in the " form of a sermon . "

While the idea was readily accepted by many in the environmentalist community , it has not been widely accepted by other scientists .
Among its more famous critics are the evolutionary biologists Richard Dawkins , Ford Doolittle , and Stephen Jay Gould .
Lovelock has responded to these criticisms with models such as Daisyworld , which illustrate how individual-level effects can translate to planetary homeostasis , under the right circumstances .
In Lovelock 's 2006 book , " The Revenge of Gaia " , he argues that the destruction of rainforests weakens Gaia 's capacity to control greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
If so , the planet 's negative feedbacks would weaken , and global warming would continue to increase .

It is made by Boeing Commercial Airplanes . <SEP> The first type of 747 was two and a half times the size of the Boeing 707 .
It was the first wide-body aircraft ever made .
The Boeing 747 made its first flight for an airline in 1970 .
The recession of 1969-1970 was very bad for Boeing .
For over a year after September 1970 , it only sold two 747s . <SEP> None were sold to an American airline for over three years .
Some airlines did not have enough passengers to fly the 747 . <SEP> Therefore , they replaced them with the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar .
Delta would later merge with Northwest Airlines , which operates 747s .
Flights which landed in smaller cities became quite usual in the 1980s .
However , many airlines still used the 747 to fly across the Pacific .
The Boeing 747 is a big , wide-body airliner . <SEP> It has four engines on the wings , and the wings are swept at 37.5 degrees , so the 747 can fly very fast .
The sweep also means that the 747 does not need any special hangars .
Since the cockpit is above the main deck , it makes a " hump " , and because it is so high , the plane can have a cargo door installed at the front .
It usually flies at Mach 0.85 – 0.855 ( up to 570 mph ) . <SEP> It can fly for 7,260 nautical miles ( 8,350 mi or 13,450 km ) .
The newest version of the 747 , the 747-8 , is now being made .
The first type of 747 was called the 747-100 . <SEP> After this , Boeing made the − 100B , which has a higher MTOW ( maximum takeoff weight ) , and the − 100SR ( Short Range ) .
It had better engines and a higher MTOW .
Airliner and cargo versions of the − 200 were made .
The 747SP ( special performance ) was also made .
In 1980 , Boeing made the 747-300 .
The first 747-300 was made in 1983 .
Then it was called the 747-200 SUD , then the 747EUD , and finally it was called the 747-300 .
In 1985 , Boeing began to design the 747-400 .
It also had new engines and a new cabin .
This meant that there were some problems with the first 747-400s .
The − 400 began being used by airlines in 1989 . <SEP> The 747-400 was the next-generation Boeing 747 introduced in 1989 .
On November 14 , 2005 , Boeing said it had changed the name of the 747 Advanced to the Boeing 747-8 .
The last 747-400s were made in 2009 .
On February 8 , 2010 , the 747-8 Freighter made its first flight .
Cargolux got the first 747-8 in 2011 .
The 747-100 was the very first type of 747 , which was made in 1966 .
The 747-200 , the next version , was made in 1968 .
The 747-300 was made in 1980 and the 747-400 was made in 1985 .
The newest version , the 747-8 , was announced in 2005 . <SEP> The most recent variant of the Boeing 747 was announced in 2005 and released on 2011 .
The International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) names these planes by combining the model number of the plane with its type number .
It includes improvements over the 747-300 including new engines , and new winglets , which improve fuel efficiency .
Its length is the same as the 747-300 but the wingspan has been increased to 211 feet 5 inches .
The 747-8 comes in two variants : 747-8I and 747-8F ( freighter ) .
The idea for the 747 was thought of in the 1960s . <SEP> It was called the 747 .
Jets like the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 had made it easy to travel long distances .
Juan Trippe from Pan American World Airways ( Pan Am ) , asked Boeing to build a plane which was more than two times bigger than the Boeing 707 .
In 1965 , Joe Sutter was told to design this new plane .
Sutter asked Pan Am and other airlines what they would like from the plane .
At the time , it was thought that supersonic aircraft would replace the 747 .
Because of this , Boeing made the 747 so that it could easily be turned into a cargo plane if the passenger version became less popular .
In April 1966 , Pan Am bought 25 747-100 planes . <SEP> The order cost US $ 525 million .
Since Pan Am was the launch customer , Pan Am had a big say in the design and making of the 747 .
On September 30 , 1968 , the first 747 was finished . <SEP> People from the 26 airlines that had ordered the 747 were also there .
The 747 first flew on February 9 , 1969 . <SEP> Its pilots were Jack Waddell and Brien Wygle .
There was a small problem with the flaps , but the 747 handled well . <SEP> The 747 did quite well when it first began to be used .
The testing was delayed because of some problems with the JT9D engines .
This meant that 747s could not be delivered for many more months .
On December 13 , 1969 the test plane was being taken to have some changes made to it .
One of the landing gears was ripped off , and two of the engines were damaged .
However , Boeing took the 747 to the 28th Paris Air Show in mid-1969 .
The very first time a 747 was used by an airline was on January 22 , 1970 . <SEP> The flight was supposed to happen on the evening of January 21 .
There were some problems , but they were quite small and they were fixed quickly .
After Pan Am began to use the plane , other airlines began to use their 747s .
Boeing thought that a lot of 747s would be sold because airlines wanted a plane which could fly for a long time , not because it was so big .
Designing the 747 was very difficult . <SEP> Building its factory was also not easy .
Boeing 's president , William M. Allen , asked Malcolm T. Stamper to be in charge of the building of the Everett factory . <SEP> He was also asked to begin building the 747 .
The factory is the biggest building ever built ( by volume ) .
Designing the 747 and building the new factory cost a lot of money . <SEP> This meant that Boeing had to borrow a lot of money from a bank .
Just before the first aircraft was finished , Boeing had to keep asking for more money . <SEP> Boeing was the only company to make very big planes for many years .
Allen said , " It was really too large a project for us . "
Since the 747-400 was made , many more types of 747 have been suggested .
Boeing said that they would make the 747-500X and -600X in 1996 .
These new planes would have cost more than US $ 5 billion to design and make .
In 2000 , Boeing said it would make a 747X to rival the Airbus A3XX .
A year later , Boeing began concentrating on the Sonic Cruiser . <SEP> The Sonic Cruiser was stopped , so Boeing then focused on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner .
Some of the ideas that Boeing had for the 747X were used on the 747-400ER .
In 2004 , Boeing said that it might work on the 747 Advanced .
The 747 Advanced used some things from the 787 to make the 747 's design more modern .
The 747 was the world 's biggest passenger plane until the Airbus A380 was finished in 2007 .
After Japanese airlines requested an aircraft to fly routes between major cities in Japan , Boeing produced the -100SR .
The first -100SR started flying with Japan Air Lines ( JAL ) on October 7 , 1973 .
A total of 7 -100SR were produced .
Later , Boeing designed a type of -100SR with the ability of taking off with greater weight . <SEP> This was the -100BSR .
It was first delivered to All Nippon Airways ( ANA ) on 21 December 1978 .
20 -100BSR were delivered to JAL and ANA .

Chemists usually build mathematical models of molecular orbitals by combining atomic orbitals . <SEP> Hybrid orbitals from each atom of the molecule , or other molecular orbitals from groups of atoms can also be used .
The word " orbital " was first used in English by Robert S. Mulliken .
Atomic orbitals predict the position of an electron in an atom . <SEP> Molecular orbitals are created when atomic orbitals are brought together .
A molecular orbital can give information about the electron configuration of a molecule . <SEP> The electron configuration is the most likely position , and the energy of one ( or one pair of ) electron ( s ) .
Mostly a MO is represented as a linear combination of atomic orbitals ( the LCAO-MO method ) , especially in approximate use .
Most present-day ways of doing computational chemistry begin by calculating the MOs of a system .
Each MO 's electric field is generated by the nuclei of all the atoms and some average distribution of the other electrons .

A parish can have city status but only if that is granted by the Crown .
In England , there are currently eight parishes with city status , all places with long-established Anglican cathedrals : Chichester , Ely , Hereford , Lichfield , Ripon , Salisbury , Truro and Wells .
Civil parishes do not cover the whole of England . <SEP> There are none in Greater London and very few in the other conurbations .
In many cases , several small villages are in a single parish .
For example , Birmingham has a parish , New Frankley , whilst Oxford has four , and Northampton has seven .
Parishes could not however be established in London until the changing of the law in 2007 and as yet none have been established there .
Civil parishes in their modern sense were established afresh in 1894 , by the Local Government Act 1894 .
The Act abolished vestries , and established elected parish councils in all rural civil parishes with more than 300 electors .
These were grouped into rural districts .
Urban parishes continued to exist , and boundaries were usually changed to be the same as the urban district or municipal borough in which they were situated .
Large towns originally split between multiple parishes were , for the most part , eventually joined into one parish .
No parish councils were formed for urban parishes , and their only function was as areas electing guardians to Poor Law Unions .
With the abolition of the poor law system in 1930 the parishes had only a nominal existence .
In some cases the detached part was in a different county .
In other cases , an entire parish was in a detached part of the county to which it belonged .
There were also many examples of parishes divided between two or more counties .

Since 1997 around 100 new civil parishes have been created , in some cases splitting existing civil parishes , but mostly by creating new ones from unparished areas .
Parish councils receive funding by levying a " precept " on the council tax paid by the residents of the parish .
Parish councils are run by volunteer councillors who are elected to serve for four years and are not paid .
Some councils have chosen to pay their elected members a small allowance as permitted under Part 5 of the Local Government Act 2000 The Local Authorities ( Members ’ Allowances ) ( England ) Regulations 2003 .
Most parish councillors are elected to represent the entire parish , though in parishes with larger populations or those that cover large areas , the parish can be divided into wards .
These wards then return a certain number of councillors each to the parish council ( depending on their population ) .
When a vacancy arises for a seat mid-term , an election is only held if a certain number ( usually 10 ) of parish residents request an election .
Every Parish Council in England must adopt a code of conduct , and parish councillors must comply with its standards , enforced by the Standards Board for England .

Stromboli is a small island in the Tyrrhenian Sea , off the north coast of Sicily . <SEP> It has one of the three active volcanoes in Italy .
Stromboli is one of the eight Aeolian Islands , a volcanic arc north of Sicily .
The volcano has erupted many times and is constantly active with minor eruptions , often visible from many points on the island and from the surrounding sea . <SEP> This gave rise to the island 's nickname " Lighthouse of the Mediterranean " .
Stromboli stands 926 m ( 3,034 ft ) above sea level , and over 2,700 m ( 8,860 ft ) on average above the sea floor .
A significant geological feature of the volcano is the " Sciara del Fuoco " ( stream of fire ) , a big horseshoe-shaped depression generated in the last 13,000 years by several collapses on the northwestern side of the cone .
Two kilometers to the northeast lies Strombolicchio , the volcanic plug remnant of the original volcano .
A brick is a man-made building material used to make walls and make places to walk . <SEP> Masons build brick walls .

The Grenfell Tower fire started shortly before 1am BST on 14 June 2017 in a tall building or tower block , Grenfell Tower , in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea , West London , England . <SEP> In the early hours of 14 June , 2017 , a fire broke out in the building , which caused massive damage to nearly all of the building .
In total , 70 fire engines , and more than 200 firefighters were trying to put out the fire . <SEP> A team of 250 firefighters from forty fire engines attempted to control the fire and rescue people .
About 72 people died in the fire .
The fire started around 00:50 BST ( UTC + 1 ) , when a fridge caught fire in flat 16 on 4th floor .
The flames spread up the side at a " terrifying rate " , By 01:29 , a rising column of flames had reached the roof and the fire was out of control .
At 04:14 , officials from the Metropolitan Police addressed the large crowd of onlookers and urgently told them to contact anyone they knew who was trapped in the building — if they are able to reach them via phone or social media — to tell them they must try to self-evacuate and not wait for the fire brigade .
According to witnesses , there were people trapped inside , waving from windows for help , some holding children .
There were also eyewitness reports that some people were jumping out .
Because of Ramadan , many were awake at the late hour .
By sunrise , the firefighters were still battling the fire and trying to spray areas where people were seen trapped .
The fire continued to burn on the tower 's upper floors into the afternoon of 14 June .
Although fears were expressed that the building could collapse , structural engineers determined that it was not in danger and that rescue teams could enter it to search for survivors , casualties and bodies .
According to the US-based manufacturer of Reynobond , the polyethylene version of the material is banned in the United States for use in buildings exceeding 40 ft in height , because of the risk of spreading fire and smoke .

They defend themselves with noxious secretions . <SEP> These are well developed , and produce noxious or even caustic secretions used to deter would-be predators .
This is typical for the ancient beetle suborder Adephaga to which they belong . <SEP> They have paired glands in the lower back of the abdomen .
In bombardier beetles these secretions are mixed with volatile compounds and ejected by a small combustion with a loud popping sound and a cloud of hot and acrid gas . <SEP> This can injure small mammals , such as shrews , and may kill invertebrate predators outright .
This ability has evolved twice – in the flanged bombardier beetles ( Paussinae ) which are among the most ancient ground beetles , as well as in the typical bombardier beetles ( Brachininae ) which are part of a more " modern " lineage .
The Anthiini can squirt their defensive secretions for considerable distances and are able to aim with a startling degree of accuracy ; in Afrikaans they are known as " " ( " eye-pissers " ) .
He discussed this in a letter : " A " Cychrus rostratus " once squirted into my eye & gave me extreme pain ; & I must tell you what happened to me on the banks of the Cam in my early entomological days ; under a piece of bark I found two carabi ( I forget which ) & caught one in each hand , when lo & behold I saw a sacred " Panagaeus cruxmajor " ; I could not bear to give up either of my Carabi , & to lose " Panagæus " was out of the question , so that in despair I gently seized one of the carabi between my teeth , when to my unspeakable disgust & pain the little inconsiderate beast squirted his acid down my throat & I lost both Carabi & " Panagæus " ! "
Ground beetles often live under the bark of trees , under logs , or among rocks or sand by the edge of ponds and rivers .
Some run fast to catch their prey ; tiger beetles ( Cicindelinae ) are certainly fast runners in comparison to their length .
Unlike most Carabidae , which are nocturnal , the tiger beetles are active daytime hunters and often brightly coloured . <SEP> They have large eyes and hunt by sight .
Ground beetles of the species " Promecognathus laevissimus " are specialised predators of the cyanide millipede " Harpaphe haydeniana " . <SEP> They can counter the hydrogen cyanide which makes these millipedes poisonous to most carnivores .

Physics is a branch of science .
It is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines . <SEP> The main goal of physics is to explain how things move in space and time and understand how the universe behaves .
Astronomy , a part of physics , is the oldest natural science . <SEP> Sciences also tend to become more quantitative with time as they become more highly developed , and physics is one of the oldest sciences .
In the past it was a part of ' natural philosophy ' with other fields of science , such as chemistry and biology . <SEP> During the scientific revolution , these fields became separate , and physics became a distinct field of knowledge .
The Sumerians , and Ancient Egyptians studied the stars , mostly with a view to prediction and religion .
Their understanding was not scientific , but their observations influenced later astronomy .
Much astronomy came from Mesopotamia , Babylonia , Ancient Egypt , and Ancient Greece .
Astronomers from Egypt built monuments that showed how objects in the sky moved , and most of the names for the constellations in the Northern hemisphere came from Greek astronomers .
Physics became a separate field of study after the scientific revolution .
Physics uses the scientific method .
Most of the theories in physics use mathematics to express their principles .
The laws of classical physics are good enough to study objects that move much slower than the speed of light , and are not microscopic .
When scientists first studied quantum mechanics , they had to create a new set of laws , which was the start of modern physics .
For example , theoretical physicists use mathematics and numerical analysis and statistics and probability and computer software in their work .
Experimental physics , engineering and technology are related .
Experiments often need specialized tools such as particle accelerators , lasers , and important industrial applications such as transistors and magnetic resonance imaging have come from applied research .

The three Tamil dynasties of Chera , Chola and Pandya were all of ancient origins .
Together they ruled over Tamil Nadu with a unique culture and language , contributing to the growth of " Sangam Literature " , some of the oldest literature in the world .
These three dynasties were in constant struggle with each other as they wanted hegemony over the land .

The First Minister and the deputy First Minister ( Irish : " Ce ́ ad-Aire agus an leas-Che ́ ad-Aire " , Ulster Scots : " Heid Ma ̈ nnyste ̀ r an tha Heid Ma ̈ nnyste ̀ r depute " ) , ( FM / dFM for short ) , are jobs in the Northern Ireland Government .
The First Minister is not more important than the deputy First Minister .
The two positions are a diarchy , meaning they have equal power ; both are nominated and appointed by members of the Northern Ireland Assembly .
The First Minister and the deputy First Minister are elected on a joint ticket .
Under the St Andrews Agreement , the Leader of the largest party nominates the First Minister , and the leader of the next largest party that is in the other group nominates the deputy First Minister .
Designated Other MLAs also vote .

Several weeks after Martin McGuinness took up office as Deputy First Minister in 2007 , civil servants began asking the Assembly 's Hansard team to replace the capital D with a lower-case d , deputy was spelled this way in the Northern Ireland Act 1998 , the legislation which created the office .
It was neither Mr McGuinness nor his advisers who asked for the change .
The Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly , William Hay , ordered the change and the capital D was dropped from Hansard references .
The Office of the First and deputy First Minister still uses both versions of Mr McGuinness ' title on their website , and their archive of press releases has been changed , but the capital D still appears in some places , and a spokesman confirmed on 20 March 2008 that the office has " no plans " to change the OFMDFM logo .
However , the Assembly committee that looks at their work is now listed as the " Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister " .
It was decided that Mr McGuinness should be the deputy First Minister , unless all the other letters in the title are in capitals .
Confusion is not completely resolved however ; if Mr McGuinness writes to the Assembly committee , his note will have a letterhead that comes from the Office of the First Minister and " Deputy " First Minister , but he 'll get a reply back from the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and " deputy " First Minister .

The book was published by the Viennese publisher FZA Verlag in October 2008 .
" Hominid " takes place several million years ago in the Central African region between rainforest and savanna .
The main characters are australopithecus afarenses , a hominid mostly living on trees that existed before the use of tools and fire .
The story is told in the first person by the main character , Pitar .
In thinking about his social and natural environment , Pitar decides to lead his family to civilization : " Hence I decided to shed some light on the darkness , to light a candle following the motto Let there be light and so on " .
His linguistic knowledge , thoughts and sayings are those of modern man , including a big knowledge about history , politics , philosophy and literature .
Several comments made by Pitar about a particular object that has not been invented or developed yet , add to the funniness of the scenario .
Pitar 's close friends are Carpediem , who says Latin phrases and quotes the writers of Classical Antiquity , and Lao , who often refers to Chinese philosophy .
Although it is difficult to convince the other characters to follow him , Pitar manages to persuade the patriarchal leader of the clan , Costello , who has taken over leadership from Thorn , who had died shortly before .
The group builds windbreaks so that they may descend more often from the trees , which has a higher risk of being attacked by wild animals on the ground .
Costello and Re are rivals . <SEP> Re not only questions the leading abilities of Costello , but also wants to possess Costello 's females .
To calm down the arising quarrel , Pitar tries to found a parliament in order to settle conflicts peacefully .
Whereas Costello thinks the parliament would be a forum in which he can strengthen his power , quoting from famous speeches by Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln , the other members ruin the idea because they have no discipline and feel indifferent .
One of the subplots of the novel shows the love between Pitar and Maluma , a female member of the group .
Costello pretends the group of females would be his personal harem , but when Maluma falls in love with Pitar , she breaks off her relationship with the leader .
On each day , the characters discover new things . <SEP> On the seventh day , everyone is exhausted from their work and needs rest .
However , the calm is broken by the attack of a saber-toothed cat .
Several members of the family are killed , including Costello , which allows Re to come to power .
Pitar and Maluma decide to leave the group , saying : “ We should leave in time , leave Re and his new Reich , which , when I 'm taking into account Thorn 's previous reign , would be the Third over here . ”
Pitar and Maluma leave toward the savanna in a move that remembers both the expulsion from paradise and the Out of Africa theory .
The novel has seven chapters , " Day 1 " to " Day 7 " , with the action of each chapter taking place on consecutive days .
The chapter titles refer to the seven days of the biblical Creation .
Only odd-numbered chapters tell the love story .

The Great Temple at Abu Simbel took about 20 years to build . <SEP> It was completed in the 24th year of the rule of Ramesses the Great ( about 1265 BC ) .
It was built for the gods Amun , Ra-Horakhty , and Ptah , as well as for Rameses himself , who was treated as a god .
It is one the grandest and most beautiful temples from the time of Rameses II , and one of the most beautiful in Egypt .
The facade of the temple has four 20 meter tall statues of the pharaoh with the double Atef crown of Upper and Lower Egypt . <SEP> All statues show Ramesses II , seated on a throne and wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt .
The facade is 35 meters wide .
These huge statues were carved into solid rock .
The statue on the left of the entrance was damaged in an earthquake soon after it was built .
Next to the legs of the large statue , there are others no higher than the knees of the pharaoh .
Above the entrance is a bas-relief with two images of the king praising the falcon-headed Ra Harakhti .
This god is holding the hieroglyph meaning " user " and a feather in his right hand , with Ma 'at , the goddess of truth and justice , in his left .
A stele on the facade records the marriage of Ramesses with a daughter of king Hattusili III , which sealed the peace between Egypt and the Hittites .
Like most Egyptian temples it has a triangle shaped layout inside . <SEP> The rooms become smaller in size from the entrance to the sanctuary .

The hypostyle hall ( sometimes also called a pronaos ) is 18 meters long and 16.7 meters wide . <SEP> It is supported by eight huge Osirid pillars .
The big statues along the left-hand wall have the white crown of Upper Egypt , while those on the opposite side are wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt ( pschent ) .

The Small Temple was built about 100 meters northeast of the Great Temple . <SEP> It was built for the goddess Hathor and Ramesses II 's favorite wife , Nefertari .
The facade is cut into solid rock , with two groups of very large statues on either side of the large gateway .

On the sides of the entrance are two statues of the king , one wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt and the other with double crown . <SEP> On sides of these are statues of the queen and the king .

On the west wall , Ramesses II and Nefertari are shown making offerings to god Horus and the gods of the Cataracts — Satis , Anubis and Khnum .

Thutmose I ( also known as " Thothmes , " " Thutmosis " or " Tuthmosis I " , meaning " Thoth-Born " ) was the third Pharaoh of the 18th dynasty of Ancient Egypt .
He became pharaoh after the death of Amenhotep I.
During his reign , he sent his armies into the Levant and Nubia , pushing the borders of Egypt further than ever before .
He built many temples in Egypt and a tomb for himself in the Valley of the Kings . <SEP> He is the first king known to have done this , though Amenhotep I may have done it first .
He was succeeded by his son Thutmose II , and then his daughter , Hatshepsut .
He ruled from 1506 to 1493 BC . <SEP> Some scholars give his dates from 1526 BC to 1513 BC .
Thutmose 's father is unknown , but it may have been Amenhotep I. His mother , Senseneb , was not from a royal family and may have been a lesser wife or concubine of Amenhotep .
Thutmose 's first son with Ahmose was Amenmose . <SEP> He was born long before Thutmose 's coronation .
He can be seen on a stela from about 1522 BC hunting near Memphis . <SEP> He became the commander of the army .
Thutmose had a son by another wife , Mutnofret .
This son , married to Thutmose 's daughter Hatshepsut , succeeded him as Thutmose II .
Hatshepsut said that Thutmose gave the kingship to them both .
However , this is considered to be propaganda by Hatshepsut 's supporters to support her claim to the throne when she later took over power .
If this observation was made at Thebes , it took place in 1517 BC .
From this date , the date of Amenhotep 's death , and Thutmose 's coronation can be calculated to 1506 BC .
But a few historians believe that the observations were made at either Heliopolis or Memphis . <SEP> This would mean that Thutmose would have been crowned in 1526 BC .
An Egyptian priest , Manetho , writing in the third century BC , said that Thutmose I 's reign lasted 12 Years and 9 Months ( or 13 Years ) .
This data is supported by two dated inscriptions from Years 8 and 9 of his reign with Thutmoses 's cartouche found on a stone block in Karnak .
Accordingly , Thutmose is usually said to have ruled from 1506 BC to 1493 BC , but some scholars date him from 1526 BC to 1513 BC
At the time Thutmose became king , Nubia rebelled against Egyptian rule .
Thutmose travelled up the Nile with his army and fought in the battle , personally killing the Nubian king .
He returned to Thebes with the Nubian king 's body hung from the front of his ship .
This helped make Nubia part of the Egyptian empire .

There is a direct relationship between UV radiation ( UVR ) and the distribution of indigenous skin pigmentation around the world .
Areas that have more UVR also have darker-skinned populations .
Areas that are far from the tropics and closer to the poles have lower concentration of UVR , and lighter-skinned populations .
Human populations have changed from dark-skinned to light-skinned as they left Africa about 100,000 years ago , and some have changed back to darker skin as they returned to higher UV zones .
Natural skin colour can also darken as a result of tanning due to exposure to sunlight .
The leading theory is that skin colour adapts to intense sunlight to provide partial protection against the ultraviolet fraction which damages DNA of the skin cells and so produces mutations .
There is a hypothesis that the selection for lighter skin is due to the need for higher vitamin D production .
In addition , adult human females are usually lighter in skin pigmentation than males .

" The Blair Witch Project " was first shown at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival . <SEP> It was released by Artisan on 30 July 1999 after months of publicity , including a ground-breaking campaign by the studio to use the Internet and suggest that the film was a record of real events .
The distribution strategy for " The Blair Witch Project " was created and implemented by Artisan studio executive Steven Rothenberg .
According to the directors of the movie , they advertised in " Back Stage " magazine for actors with strong improvisational abilities .
There was a very informal improvisational audition process to narrow the total amount of 2,000 actors .
In talks with investors of the movie , they presented an eight-minute documentary along with newspapers and news footage .
In the movie , the Blair Witch is , according to legend , the ghost of Elly Kedward , a woman banished from the Blair Township ( latter-day Burkittsville ) for witchcraft in 1785 .
The directors incorporated that part of the legend , along with allusions to the Salem Witch Trials and " The Crucible " , to play on the themes of injustice done on those who were called witches .
They were influenced by " The Shining " , " Alien " and " The Omen . "
" Jaws " was an influence as well , presumably because the witch was hidden from the viewer for the entirety of the film , forcing suspense from the unknown .
Most of the movie was filmed in the tiny Seneca Creek State Park in Montgomery County , Maryland , although a few scenes were filmed in the real town of Burkittsville .
Donahue said she modeled her character after a director she once worked with , citing the character 's self assuredness when everything went as planned , and confusion during crisis .

Soon , they discover a multitude of humanoid stick figures suspended from trees .
That night , they hear more strange noises , including the sounds of children and bizarre " morphing " sounds .
When an unknown force shakes the tent , they flee in a panic and hide in the woods until it is morning .
Upon returning to their tent , they find that their possessions have been rifled through , and Josh 's equipment is covered with slime , causing them to question why only his belongings were affected .
As the day wears on , they pass a log over a stream that was identical to the one they had passed earlier , despite having traveled directly south all day , and again set camp , completely demoralized at having wasted the entire day seemingly going in circles , with Josh outside on guard duty .
Josh disappears the next morning . <SEP> After a while of finding him , Mike and Heather eventually break camp and slowly move on .
That night , they hear Josh screaming in the darkness , but are not able to find him .
The next morning , Heather finds a bundle of sticks and fabric outside their tent .
Later inspection reveals it contains blood-soaked scraps of Josh 's shirt , as well as teeth and hair , but she does not mention this to Mike .
That night , Heather records herself apologizing to the co-producers of her project as well as her family , and starts to cry , finally admitting her fate .
Later , they again hear Josh crying for help , but this time they follow them and discover an abandoned house in the woods .
Mike runs upstairs , following the voice , while Heather tries to follow .
Mike then claims he hears Josh in the basement .
Heather runs down to the basement screaming for Mike , but she does not hear Mike .

The eruptive history of Mt Garibaldi involves an initial period of volcanism ( 200,000-300,000 years ago ) followed by a period of quiescence .
Subsequent rapid melting of the ice at the close of the last ice age removed support from the western part of the cone .
The steep , northern edge of the Rubble Creek flow party collapsed several times , most recently in 1855-1856 ; the village of Garibaldi was abandoned because of the danger of future collapses .
The Ring Creek flow is very unusual . <SEP> It is 15 km long - a length usually only attained by basalt flows , except that the Ring Creek flow is dacite .
Renewed volcanism in the Garibaldi area would pose a serious threat to the local communities of Whistler and Squamish .
Although no Plinian-style eruptions are known , even Pelean-type eruptions could produce large quantities of ash that could rise to several hundred meters above the volcano .
The danger from lava flows would be low to moderate because the nature of the lavas would prevent them from travelling far from their source , even though the Ring Creek lava flow ends only 6 km from Squamish .
Melting of remnant glacial ice capping the Mt . Garibaldi area could produce floods , lahars , or debris flows that might endanger small communities including Brackendale .
Highway 99 , which links Whistler and Squamish with Vancouver , is already plagued by landslides and dedris flows from the precipitous Coast Mountains .
An eruption producing floods could destroy segments of the highway .
Flooding and debris flows could also have serious coneequences for the salmon fishery on the Squamish , Cheakamus , and Mamquam rivers .
In addition , explosive eruptions and the accompanying ash could cause short and long-term water-supply problems for Vancouver and much of the lower mainland .
The catchment area for the Greater Vancouver watershed is downwind from the Garibaldi area .
Air-fall material could also have a deleterious effect on the ice fields to the east of Mt . Garibaldi , causing increased melting and spring flooding .
This in turn could theaten water supplies from Pitt Lake as well as fisheries on the Pitt River .

Sympatric speciation refers to the formation of two or more descendant species from a single ancestral species all occupying the same geographic location . <SEP> In sympatric speciation , species diverge while inhabiting the same place .
One widely accepted example of sympatric speciation is that of the cichlids of Lake Nabugabo in East Africa , which is thought to be due to sexual selection .
One example of evolution at work is the case of the hawthorn fly , " Rhagoletis pomonella " , which appears to be undergoing sympatric speciation .
Some evidence suggests that sympatric speciation is occurring . <SEP> Hawthorn flies mature later in the season and take longer to mature than apple flies ; and there is little evidence of interbreeding ( researchers have documented a 4-6 % hybridization rate ) .
The Nineteenth Amendment overturned an earlier decision by the United States Supreme Court in " Minor v. Happersett " .
The Nineteenth Amendment was first introduced in Congress in 1878 by Senator Aaron A. Sargent .
Finally , in 1919 , Congress approved the amendment and submitted it to the states for ratification .
The plaintiffs challenged the Nineteenth Amendment as being unconstitutional .
They argued first , that the amendment was invalid because it increased the electorate without the state of Maryland 's consent .
They argued secondly that ratification was based on several states that denied women the right to vote in their state constitutions and therefore their legislatures did not have the right to ratify the amendment . <SEP> The second argument , that certain state legislatures did not have the power to ratify based on their own constitutions , is rejected because they were ratifying an amendment to the federal Constitution , and so is a federal function .
In a unanimous decision , the court rejected all three arguments .
The Court ruled the third argument a moot point because two other states after Tennessee and West Virginia ( Connecticut and Vermont ) who followed their own procedures would have been enough to ratify the amendment .

Sigilmassasaurus was a carnivorous theropod dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of Africa . <SEP> Its name means " " ' ' Sijilmassa lizard " , referring to the name of the city near the place where its fossils were found .
Its species name " brevicollis " is Latin for " short neck " , because the neck bones of the animal are very short .
It was found and named by a Canadian paleontologist called Dale Russel in 1996 , he found the fossils in Morocco at a fossil site called the Kem Kem Formation .
The rocks the skeleton was found in are as old as the Cenomanian , which is the earliest stage of the Late Cretaceous Period , 100 to 94 million years ago .
Several large predatory dinosaurs weighing more than one tonne are known from the Late cretaceous of North Africa , this made paleontologists wonder how so many of them would have lived together .
The situation is a lot like in the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation of North America , where there were up to five meat-eating dinosaurs weighing more than a tonne , as well as many smaller ones .

Histones are proteins found in eukaryotic cell nuclei , which package the DNA into structural units called nucleosomes .
They are the chief protein components of chromatin , the active component of chromosomes . <SEP> Histones act as spools around which DNA winds , and play a role in gene regulation .
Without histones , the unwound DNA in chromosomes would be very long .
For example , each human cell has about 1.8 meters of DNA , but wound on the histones it has about 90 millimeters of chromatin , which , when duplicated and condensed during mitosis , result in about 120 micrometers of chromosomes .
This packs in the large genomes of eukaryotes to fit inside cell nuclei . <SEP> The compacted molecule is 40,000 times shorter than an unpacked molecule .
Histones are found in the nuclei of eukaryotic cells , and in certain Archaea , namely Euryarchaea , but not in bacteria .
Histone proteins are among the most highly conserved proteins in eukaryotes , which suggests they are vital to the biology of the nucleus . <SEP> Core histones are highly conserved proteins , that is , there are very few differences among the amino acid sequences of the histone proteins of different species .
In contrast , mature sperm cells largely use protamines to package their genomic DNA , most likely to achieve an even higher packaging ratio .

In 2004 , the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research ( JINR ) team in Dubna , Moscow Oblast , Russia planned an experiment to synthesize ( create ) element 117 .
To do this , they needed to fuse the elements berkelium ( element 97 ) and calcium ( element 20 ) . <SEP> Since tennessine has 117 protons , they need another atom with 97 protons to be combined with the calcium atom , and berkelium has 97 protons .
The Russian team wanted to use berkelium because the isotope of calcium used in the experiment , calcium-48 , has 20 protons and 28 neutrons .
The calcium beam is created in Russia by removing the small amount of calcium-48 from natural calcium using chemical means .
The nuclei that is made after the experiment will be heavier and is nearer to the island of stability .
However , there were still problems : Russian customs did not let the berkelium target get into the country twice due to missing or incomplete paperwork .
Even though the target went over the Atlantic Ocean five times , the whole journey only took a few days .
This film was then sent to Dubna where it was placed inside the JINR particle accelerator .

The class has two living subclasses .
In the Coleoidea , the mollusc shell has become smaller , or is not there at all ; this subclass has the octopus , squid , and cuttlefish .
There are at least 800 different living species of Cephalopods .
Two important extinct taxa are the Ammonites , and the Belemnites ( order " Belemnoidea " , of class Coleoidea ) .
Cephalopods are found in all the oceans of the world and at all pelagic levels .
None of them can live in freshwater ( water with no salt in it ) , but a few species live in brackish ( partly salty ) water .
Most cephalopods have chromatophores – that is , cells with different colours – which they can use in a number of surprising ways .
As well as blending with their background , some cephalopods bioluminesce , shining light downwards to hide their shadows from any attackers .
The bioluminescence is made by bacterial symbionts ; the host cephalopod is able to find the light made by these animals .
Bioluminescence may also be used to attract prey , and some species use colourful shows to get mates , amaze predators , or even signal to one another .
Colouration can be changed in milliseconds as they adjust to their environment , and the pigment cells can expand or contract .
Rapid colour change is usually more common in near-shore species than those living in the open ocean .
Cephalopods usually move by jet propulsion ( squirting water ) . <SEP> This uses a lot of energy to travel compared to the tail propulsion used by fish .
The efficiency of jet propulsion goes down with larger animals .
Oxygenated water is taken into the mantle cavity to the gills . <SEP> By contracting the mantle 's muscles , the water is pushed out through the siphon , made by a fold in the mantle .
Motion of the cephalopods is usually backward as water is forced out forwards , but the siphon can be pointed in different directions .
